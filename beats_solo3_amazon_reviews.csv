Paul Ratzlaff,5,"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears. I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better. I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best.","November 27, 2023"

**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**
Two notes about me:
* I have a pretty average sized head & ears
* I wear glasses

Thoughts:
- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.
- I can FEEL the bass.
- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.
- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I’ve heard.
- Classical sounds amazing—way better than AirPods Pro 2.
- Folk sounds amazing, & it’s like someone’s playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.
- Piano also sounds especially amazing
- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there—they also barely fit (see pictures).
- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).
- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.
- Box is very sleek & giftable.
- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.
- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it’s not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it’s not so uncomfortable that I don’t want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.
- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it’s not any real inconvenience.
- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out—USB-C or a lightening cord would’ve been way better.
- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.
- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it’s a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn’t trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that’d be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it’s just barely big enough for that.
- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don’t have that and I’m left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.

In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you’re looking for good bluetooth headphones and don’t have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn’t be happier. They’re definitely a good value at $200, but they’re mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren’t are barely worth commenting on.

Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not. I’d highly recommend buying if they’re in your budget!!!","October 17, 2023"
Gabbie,5,"I’ve always been a fan of Beats headphones. They’re durable, comfortable and compact!

My headphones came brand new; Unopened, just as I expected! They were fully charged and ready to go straight out of the package.

These headphones provide me optimum performance and comfort. I have sensitive ears and treble sounding headphones aggravate them and cause pain. Because these headphones have a really high quality bass sound to them, I can listen and enjoy stress and discomfort free!

I bought the silver pair. In person, they look very sleek and have a clean look. Their appearance is great and leaves nothing to be desired!

The setup of these headphones was super easy. All I had to do was turn them on, and they instantly connected to my phone without having to do so manually.

Beats gets a 5 star rating from me!","December 5, 2023"
Eddie P.,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and I have been thoroughly impressed with their performance. These headphones are the perfect blend of style and substance, making them a fantastic choice for both audiophiles and fashion-conscious individuals.

First and foremost, the sound quality is exceptional. The bass is punchy, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes, podcasts, or watching movies, the audio experience is immersive and satisfying. The Beats Solo3 headphones truly deliver on their promise of high-quality sound.

The wireless connectivity is a game-changer. With the Apple W1 chip, pairing these headphones with my devices is a breeze. I appreciate the convenience of not having to deal with tangled wires, and the Bluetooth connection has been rock-solid with no dropouts. The impressive 40-hour battery life ensures that these headphones last for days without needing a recharge, making them perfect for long trips or extended listening sessions.

Comfort is also a big plus. The on-ear design is lightweight, and the cushioned ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort during extended use. The adjustable headband makes it easy to find the perfect fit for any head shape.

The design is sleek and stylish, with the iconic ""b"" logo on the ear cups and a variety of color options to choose from. These headphones not only sound great but also make a fashion statement.

The built-in controls on the ear cups allow for easy volume adjustment, track skipping, and even phone calls, without the need to reach for your device. The integrated microphone provides clear call quality, and I've had no issues with hands-free calling.

In summary, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a superb combination of style and audio quality. If you're in the market for a reliable and fashionable pair of wireless headphones, these are an excellent choice. They offer a fantastic audio experience, easy connectivity, long battery life, and a comfortable fit, all wrapped up in a chic design.

AmazonCustomer,5,"These headphones are A1 quality.

PROS: The Bluetooth connection to my iPhone was seamless, took less than 30 seconds to do. The sound? AMAZING. You can feel the bass thumping in your ear. Apart from the crisp sound, the noise cancellation is insane. The buttons are smooth and don’t make an annoying clicking sound. They are super lightweight. The charging speed is superb. I’ve let them completely die and a 30 min charge gives me hours of use. Comes with a nice carrying case although not a hard shell case like previous Beats headphones I’ve had before, still great addition. The case itself also has a small pocket for the charging cord plus a carabiner for clipping to your backpack, purse, etc.

CONS: Although the headphone ear pieces are plush they do start to bother your ears after a while. Wish they’d come with additional sizes of them for different ear shapes. Charger cord is shorter than the average USB, I have to leave it on top of something or on the floor to fully reach.","November 30, 2023"
Rambling S.,5,"These headphones have Excellent sound quality and comfort. I only wish the pads were a bit larger in diameter. I regret that I didn't notice that they come with a nice compact, protective and very packable case, which has a ""corral"" for the charging cord.
Pairing with Apple devices is very easy. Just have blue tooth on, and it happens.
My one regret with this order does not detract from these phones. I mention it sort of as a plus for the product. I didn't realize that they come with a padded protected zippered case. I wasted my money on 2 larger molded thin plastic clamshell cases, (recommended by Amazon)', which are disappointing, as they take up much more room in luggage, and in my tech napsack and on the shelf at home. I'm sure I'll find a use for the clamshells, but they are a bulky inconvenience to storage.. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on what turned out to be extra cases. The case that comes with these headphones is just right for my purposes.","November 10, 2023"
Ishdelalv,5,"Sound great and but not really my first choice. I keep losing my AirPods and this one unless I drop or forget by accident somewhere i can still at least where and how I lost them, is for travel or listen in a safe place but not in the street or be multitasking with because you are practically not aware of things around and not too functional but work for me . is light but not necessarily practical or wearable at work or around for multitasking activities, I use less them and the blue tooth connection is not as automatic as I wish, connect and disconnect and a little but frágil where the power bttm is . , I am not worry about loosing them at all not too happy using its is what it’s.","November 5, 2023"
ro,5,"Bought this as a replacement to the one I wore out (ear foam coming off and the plastic broke at the extension site so I duct taped it together..) ...and I like this one much better as the battery life is longer! My hair does get tangled up in the space between the control button and the ear, so I""ve had hair pulled out every time I take it off. And I bought the service agreement this time too.","November 30, 2023"
S. Hopper,5,They are so cute and small! The perfect size I love them so much! I needed headphones for the gym! Great price and caught them on sale! Merry Christmas to me! They are loud unlike the beats fit pro earbuds and the new studio 3s! Buy these you won’t regret it!,"December 7, 2023"
Quiet,5,"I was a little hesitant because it seemed a little like they weren't 'top of the line'. I love my Beats. I don't know how they do it, but what amazing sound in such light and easy headphones.
i just got a pair for a birthday present for a family member, and i know they will love them too!!","December 5, 2023"
Victor,5,Got these for a great price on prime day for $99! Can’t beat that price for the value. Excellent quality and it supports Spatial Audio with Apple Music. Battery lasts forever i haven’t had to charge it but twice when I first received it and a few weeks ago.,"December 8, 2023"
Ms. Nickie,5,"Arrived fast in original wrapping. Unboxed with little brother soon as he seen them he wanted to use them. When I went to get my headphones he begged me out of them. I had to buy another pair. Sound is good, can tell when someone is talking to you long as you're looking at them but you can't hear them. Easy to change name once connect to phone. Came with a little carrying case and attachment to keep close. He puts them on his book bag & I put them on my gym bag. I feel like I got a deal. so... Go ahead and get the deal just don't show your little brother. lol","November 7, 2023"
Noel Monsalve,5,"The Beat Solo 3 is a good solution if you do not want super bulky headphones that are heavy, easy to take for your work out sessions, and for relaxation moments. the noise cancelation featured is really good and the sound quality is 8 out of 10.

one of the best products you can get out there for this price. in my opinion, do not miss-out on these opportunities.","November 28, 2023"
Jacklyn Best,5,"Great price for awesome sound quality and gets very loud or really quiet. They don’t have noise cancellation however they block out plenty of noise without it. Works even better than many of the more expensive noise cancellation headphones that are over $200!
Highly recommend these headphones!","December 6, 2023"
Jay,5,Don’t get me wrong they aren’t super special but compared to my other headphones they are an upgrade. These have some noise cancellation and I like the sound in the headphones. Quality sound plus it does good with bass which is nice.,"December 8, 2023"
Tam Hicks,5,"First, love the red color. The sound is phenomenal. Music inside my head. The only thing I don't like is the bulky size when folded up in case. At least the charger cord fits in case also. They're not ear buds for sure. I was concerned I'd lose those tiny things! These are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The sound is true and noise is blocked out.","November 24, 2023"
Jamaya Cole,5,LOVE THESE 1. They are definitely noise camcel idc what nb say 😂 I’m never going back to AirPods and I’m never taking thee off unless it’s a must.

Scheba,5,Worth the money I use my beats to workout out b/c my AirPods kept slipping off while working out and when I put my beats on I can’t hear what around me and it’s not sound cancellation get it while sale is 50% off.,"December 4, 2023"
Theresa M Leszek,5,These headphones have been with me through thick and thin. They are broken on both sides. Rainbow unicorn duck tape holding them together. Cracks and the cushion is started to fall apart but the sound NEVER faltered. These headphones refuse to die and that’s great for some one who is clumsy but also broke 👍🏻,"December 3, 2023"
A Duane,5,"I remember when Beats first came out, they were so expensive - that's not the case now. I have used airpods for a few years because of their convince but for use in my home office or on a plane, I'll use the Beats. Can't go wrong.","November 29, 2023"
Sherrybine Accime,5,And I love me some BEATS. Always a couple on me since high school and I love them for working out and just general music use. Very good base and sound quality for price of course. Even got them for $99 on Amazon sale 💁🏾‍♀️,"November 27, 2023"

L. Graham,5,"I love wearing these at work because they’re just cute. The sound quality is incredible and I’ve had zero connectivity issues. The battery charge lasts for a long time. I wish the actual parts over the ears were just slightly bigger because they do rest right on my double helix piercing causing some discomfort. Other than that, these are almost perfect!","November 20, 2023"
Keyana Daniel,5,"These headphones I got for a roadtrip, but now I use them for main activities like before bed or school. And the bass is incredible, has apple care as well!

Chele,5,"I've been using earphones for 10+ years and recently I've been having ear problems. I've been on the hunt for good headphones for a little over a year. Everyone I tried was either too big or the sound wasn't that great. I didn't want to spend that much money, but I was also tired of returning so many. I guess sometimes you do need to pay more. I finally gave in and tried a pair of Beats to see why so many love them. Thankfully, I caught this on sale when it was $129 so I did save quite a lot haha.

First off, they actually fit my head! I also didn't realize how small my ears were since the ear cups cover my entire ears, even though these are on ear cups haha! So if you have small ears and don't like over the ears cups, you may not like these (but I still suggest trying them since I personally don't like over the ear headphones but these don't bother me).

Second, they sound amazing. I LOVE hearing the bass and these provide a great bass sound! I was hesitant a little since I've heard that they sound differently on Android vs Apple. I have an Android phone but use a MacBook and iPad (don't judge me haha) and I don't tell any difference in the sound regardless of which OS/device I'm using.

Lastly, the battery life may be better than they say. I had my pair 100% charged the day before Hurricane Idalia hit and they lasted the entire week we were without power. I used them everyday for hours and still had 38% left when power was restored.

If you can afford to get these - I do suggest them!","September 16, 2023"

"I recently purchased the TruActive Premium Bike Phone Mount Holder, and I have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. It is no surprise that it has been recognized as Amazon's Choice. This phone mount offers a secure and reliable way to keep your phone in place while cycling or riding on your motorcycle or ATV. One thing that I appreciate about this phone mount is its universal compatibility. It is designed to fit any phone and handlebar, making it extremely versatile. Whether you have an iPhone, Samsung, or any other smartphone, this mount will securely hold your device in place. Another standout feature of this phone mount is the tool-free installation. It is incredibly easy to attach and detach the mount from your bike or motorcycle. The hassle-free installation process ensures that you can quickly and effortlessly set it up and get on with your ride. I also love that this phone mount comes with six interchangeable color bands. This allows you to customize the look of your mount to match your bike or personal style. It's a small touch, but it adds a fun and personalized element to the overall experience. Furthermore, the TruActive Premium Bike Phone Mount Holder offers a secure grip on your phone, ensuring that it stays in place even on rough terrains. The mount's silicone bands provide excellent shock absorption and prevent any accidental slips or drops. Overall, I highly recommend the TruActive Premium Bike Phone Mount Holder.

Angel,4,"The best headphones. I was looking for the perfect headphones with the qualities of sound cancellation , durability, color and comfortability and I found the perfect ones. How i even found out about this product is because one day i was working out at the gym with my cousin and i need music loud enough and my airpods was not loud enough for me so me and my cousin swapped and i was so satisfied with the loudness of it and i was so focused and encouraged to finish my workout. I really like these because of the sound cancellation mostly , when I am doing my school work working out and I don't want to hear anything I put these on and everything on the outside just goes mute and the headphones just do their job. In a lot of headphones I feel like the advertisement is really fake. As someone who has tried the majority of wireless headphones this one is probably one of my favorites so far. But I do have some dislikes and likes about this product starting off with the dislikes . first thing i would like to start of with is how big the headphones are like there so noticeable and there just there i wish there were smaller nad like airpods sort of another dislike is u could hear the music out the headphones loud and clear so it's like whatever your listing to others can hear which i honestly hate that. Next is that you can lay down with them like if u were laying down on your ear its just super uncomfortable because like i said on how big it is. Now let's move on to the like starting off with the ear muffs they put on the headphone . The earmuffs are what makes this product super comfortable and if it's cold your ears will be warm because of the earmuffs. Next is the loudness of course like i said in the beginning and the sound cancellation. Finally, I love how this product has multiple colors and they are all beautiful but the color I have is just out of this world which is the pink rose gold color love love love this color is just such a pretty color and it's my type of vibe. My honest review for the headphone is 4.8/5 these are great headphones and they have everything you need in them i just personally don't like hoe big and bulky they are and how you can hear the music outside the headphones but other than that love this product and i highly recommend you buy this for a friend or family member or even yourself if your looking for a headphone with noise cancellation and loudness to it .","November 28, 2023"
Boo99,4,"I gave them 4 stars cause I've yet to find better sounding headphones out there.

But the same issue happened in two of these where the left side just stopped working. One it took a year. And the most recent took 2.5 yrs.

Still the best sound and volume I could find in headphones on ear.

The Bluetooth distance is incredible. Way further than 33 feet they say it can go.

So had to buy another one today but didn't want to wait a week for Amazon to come so got one at Walmart for same price.

I think it's a wire loosening up cause if I twist the left side I can hear some sound.

There's YouTube videos of a fix but WAY too complicated for my skills b","December 5, 2023"
anyssa,4,"These headphones are good if your looking for something with good quality sound. They aren’t noise cancelling, but still do a pretty good job of blocking out external sounds.

My biggest issue was the size of the parts that go over your ear. I’m fairly petite and these were too small for me. Instead of sitting over your ears, they sit on your ears and becomes uncomfortable after a couple hours of use.

They also don’t have much control buttons on the side. Just enough to change volume and play/pause but no buttons to change the song.

These aren’t bad headphones, but I do think there are better ones around","December 9, 2023"
Sarah,4,"The sound quality on these allows for one to have a truly immersive experience. The battery life is long. Connection with blue tooth is clear and strong. These are so close to perfect. Would give a 5 star had I not have TMJ and be sensitive to pressure and weight, which triggers headaches, painful face, jaw, ear tension. I’ve tried many adjustments for more comfort. If I go as big as I need for that, they slide off while I dance. Not dancing, isn’t an option. Leaving this honest review for fellow neck and head tension holders. I still use them when I can, just comes a bit of a physical

Man K. Wong,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, they have left a lasting impression on me. From their sleek design to impressive sound quality and long-lasting battery life, these headphones have become my constant companion for both daily commutes and intense workout sessions.

First and foremost, the design of the Beats Solo3 headphones is striking. The sleek and streamlined appearance, combined with the iconic Beats logo, exudes a sense of modernity and style. The headphones come in a variety of attractive colors, allowing users to express their personality and preferences. The on-ear design is comfortable and snug, providing a secure fit that stays in place even during vigorous activities.

The sound quality is undeniably excellent. The Beats Solo3 headphones deliver a powerful and bass-heavy sound signature that suits various music genres. The bass response is deep without overpowering the vocals and trebles, resulting in an immersive audio experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks, watching movies, or playing games, the headphones never fail to impress with their rich and dynamic sound.

The wireless connectivity is a game-changer. Pairing the Beats Solo3 with my devices is effortless, thanks to the Apple W1 chip. The Bluetooth connection remains stable and reliable, allowing me to move around without any dropouts. Additionally, the on-ear controls are intuitive and easy to use, enabling me to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with a simple tap.

The battery life of the Beats Solo3 headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge, I rarely have to worry about running out of power during extended use. Moreover, the Fast Fuel feature is incredibly handy, providing three hours of playback after just a 5-minute charge, perfect for those last-minute situations.

The headphones also feature a built-in microphone, which works well for making calls and using voice assistants like Siri. However, the microphone's performance in noisy environments could be improved, as it tends to pick up background noise.

Comfort-wise, the on-ear design may not be suitable for everyone, especially during prolonged wear. Some users might experience slight discomfort or ear fatigue after extended use, but this can be alleviated by adjusting the fit and taking short breaks.

While the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones deliver impressive sound quality and wireless convenience, the premium price tag might be a deterrent for some budget-conscious consumers. However, the product's performance and brand reputation are likely to justify the investment for audiophiles and fans of the Beats brand.

In conclusion, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a stylish and reliable choice for music enthusiasts seeking powerful sound and seamless wireless functionality. With a few minor improvements in comfort and microphone performance, these headphones could easily score a perfect rating. If you prioritize style, sound quality, and long-lasting battery life, the Beats Solo3 headphones won't disappoint.","July 24, 2023"
Ben Huro,4,The product sounds good but they are not they seem fake. I mean should have know. The bag that came with seem like it was rushed to put be sown on. The letter “b” on the bag was not aligned properly it just seem rushed. But it sounds good. I just didn’t like how it look real on the picture that they advertised but it’s not the actual beat. I mean I could be wrong but that’s just how I see it.,"December 10, 2023"
D. L. Stevens,4,"I love Beats Solo 3. This is my second pair, the other being wired. Some may find it has too much base. It does get hard on the ears after pressing against them for more than 30 minutes. However, the sound quality is fantastic. I'm no audiophile so take this as you will. Compared to my red wired Beats Solo 3, the color for the wireless is a hybrid of pink/orange. Not a deal breaker by any means. Just putting it out there. Great black Friday deal for $99.00.","December 3, 2023"
Samantha,4,"For anyone like me that wants a new headset for work calls, but isn't allowed to use Bluetooth on their work computer- this will work with an aux cable! I bought an Amazon basics aux cable and it seems to work with a slight delay, but it works, so I'll accept it for now. (I tried to use the USB charging cord first, but that only allowed the person to hear me, I couldn't hear them)","December 1, 2023"
Cristina,4,"I really like these! I got them about a month ago and their battery hasn't died on me yet, the audio quality is great, they're super easy to connect to ANY device, and the design is nice.
However... there are two things I don't love about them:
1) They don't have a skip button (but I manage)
2) After working for a long time (around 2 hrs) my ears start to hurt and I have to take them off for a few minutes, I've tried them while working out and have the same problem :(","November 20, 2023"
Nida,4,"I liked the look and feel of the head puffs.
I like it is smaller in size, so it is not two big puffs for winter or something on my ears.

However,
It says its connected to my laptop and then it doesn't have any volume. I have to disconnect and reconnect it and then it plays again. Not a major issue, but a tad annoying. it has happened a few times.

Second, the left ear puff, I believe it is a little small. It hurts my ear, while the other ear piece ( on the right) is the perfect size and covers my ear perfectly.

Never fall asleep with the headset on, it does cause me to have a headache ( probably because it starts hurting my left ear)

Otherwise, if it's used for a few hours at at time, (studying, listening to lectures) it is perfect. Also, easy packing it and sleek style are ideal. I am not regretting the purchase, I use it and I have enjoyed it. I do wear them for less duration due ot the pain ti causes in my ear due to the small size and constant pressure on the Cartledge.","September 26, 2023"
Roxanne,4,"I love these headphones but my hair is always getting caught in them! Which makes them a bit unpleasant

Heather Delaney,4,"I used these once before and loved them, so I bought my own on prime day. But the noise cancellation could be much better. At work on break I can hear my co workers talking while I’m using them which is a bummer. And that’s with only 2 in the room :( I have to blast the volume up to full to cancel them out and still hear murmurs. Great quality and great battery life though. They’re comfy but not the best option for those with gauged ears. I have them and it causes slight discomfort.","October 25, 2023"
Amazon Customer,4,"I was expecting a lot from these headphones based on the reviews. After using these headphones for a week here are my pros and cons

• pretty comfortable, fit well
• easy to connect to devices
• stay on head well, don’t fall off when moving around
Cons: • sound is just okay, no way to adjust
• doesn’t have different settings for noise cancellation or aware mode","November 7, 2023"
tanya drofyak,4,"I see a lot of reviews claiming the noise cancelling isn’t good- well that’s because they’re not noise cancelling nor claimed to be by BEATS. Not the most comfortable, it’s a little too must pressure on the direct ear. Quality of sound is very good and clear! Packaging is aesthetic. Good overall purchase, but if your on the look for something better without too much care regarding brand I’d recommend the Sony wireless Bluetooth noise cancelling for an overall cheaper price & better quality","November 3, 2023"
Nat,4,The headset feels luxurious and it’s nice that It folds into itself for travel. I like the sound quality and the battery seems to last a long time. It feels a little bit tight on the head though and that is my biggest complain as I bought this for a 9 hour flight.,"November 14, 2023"
Diana,4,"Ive never been a fan of over the ear headphones but working out with the little buds that keep falling out is annoying so i got these. I love that they are smaller so it doesnt look soo big on my head.

I’m unable to load a screenshot of the page.","November 24, 2023"
HS98,4,"I do wish they would play a little louder, but it’s still loud enough to satisfy your needs. The noise cancelling level is very good.

These also work super well with Apple products!!","October 30, 2023"

Lawrence Lomenzo,4,"The Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones offer a high-performance audio experience, and despite a few limitations, they prove to be a solid choice for those seeking a blend of convenience and exceptional sound quality.

One of the standout features of these headphones is the integration of the Apple W1 chip, providing Class 1 wireless Bluetooth connectivity. This chip ensures a reliable and stable wireless connection, allowing you to enjoy your favorite tunes without interruption. With seamless pairing capabilities, the Beats Solo3 headphones effortlessly connect to your iOS or Android devices, making them compatible with a wide range of smartphones and tablets.

Battery life is often a crucial factor for wireless headphones, and the Beats Solo3 truly impresses in this department. Boasting an impressive 40 hours of playback time, these headphones can effortlessly accompany you throughout your day without the need for frequent recharging. Additionally, the Fast Fuel technology is a game-changer, providing three hours of playback after just five minutes of charging when your battery is running low. This feature comes in handy, especially for those on the go who need a quick burst of power.

Comfort is key during extended listening sessions, and the Beats Solo3 delivers with its adjustable fit and comfort-cushioned ear cups. Designed for everyday use, these headphones provide a snug and personalized fit, allowing you to enjoy your music without any discomfort. The sleek and streamlined design not only looks stylish but also enhances durability, ensuring that these headphones can withstand the demands of daily use. Moreover, the foldable design makes them highly portable, allowing you to take them with you wherever you go.

While the Beats Solo3 headphones excel in various aspects, there is one important consideration to bear in mind. In my particular case there is an issue with the right side ear cup. It stopped working after only a few months of use when connected via Bluetooth. However, it's worth noting that this problem does not occur when using a direct connection through the 3.5mm audio cable, where the sound quality remains excellent. Therefore, if you heavily rely on Bluetooth connectivity, it would be wise to approach this purchase with caution.

In conclusion, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a powerful audio companion that offers an immersive listening experience with its high-performance sound and long battery life. The Apple W1 chip ensures seamless wireless connectivity, and the comfort-cushioned ear cups provide a comfortable fit for everyday use. Although the reported issue with the right side ear cup when using Bluetooth is a concern, using a direct connection through the audio cable resolves this problem. If you're willing to work around this limitation, these headphones are a worthwhile investment for those seeking convenience, style, and impressive sound quality.","May 20, 2023"

Pairing them with my devices was a breeze thanks to the Apple W1 chip and Class 1 Bluetooth connectivity. It connects so quickly and maintains a strong connection without any hiccups. It's just so convenient not to worry about wires getting in the way anymore!

The battery life is another big plus. I can use them for a long time before needing to recharge, which is super handy, especially when I'm on the go.

Not to forget, they look really stylish and are comfortable to wear for extended periods.

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. If you're looking for wireless headphones that offer both quality and style, these are a great pick!","September 11, 2023"
J. Starr,4,"Beautifully packaged, good sound but they weren’t as noise cancelling as I expected. I was hoping they would block out more.

Jay,4,"I am a trained musician, vocalist, and used music as an outlet for self-expression. I became deaf in my adult years after sustaining a near fatal head injury that resulted in bilateral hearing loss. For 20+ years I went through life reading lips, facial expressions and tried to get by. Music was no longer part of my life. I eventually qualified for cochlear implant (CI) surgery where I can once again hear sounds and music. This is my third pair of a top brand over the ears headphones and the best for CI users. The CI is controlled by the user especially for music. However, not all headphones are alike. Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones have significant power to drive sound, the noise cancellation feature reduces significantly ambient noise so that music is delivered to the CI user without outside interference. Gripping the head is very important since CI devices rest atop the external ear. Beats Headphone has a firm grip. On occasion while training with weights in the gym, they start to slip off my head, due to sweat, particularly with bent over barbell rows or abdominal exercises. They are ideal for cardio exercise on a treadmill, elliptical trainer, etc especially if the gym provides its own ambient indoor music so that the Beats Headphone noise cancellation and significant power help me hear my music delivered by my smart phone. The only complaint is that the cushions are plastic, instead of removable fabric. Another brand has fabric cushions feature but delivers inferior output as a CI user. If you use hearing aids or cochlear implants, I recommend Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones. I cant address its functionality as to having phone calls. I just want to hear my upbeat music while training in the gym. I am a satisfied customer. Deaf people just have different requirements when it comes to over the ear headphone specs.","June 4, 2023"
jeannie,4,"As the title says, these headphones are tight. Over long listening period, you need to take a break from wearing them because they put too much pressure on the sides of your head, causing discomfort. The sound is good. It looks good.

Meghan U.,4,"I owned Beats Studio3 prior to this, and found the Studio ear cuffs to be much more comfortable. The Solo cuffs put a lot of pressure on my right ear.

3. The sound is amazing for my music 🎼/ block outside noise.
4 . Instructions are very simple.
5. They had different colors to choose from and I will pick a girly color next time so I don’t have to share with my son.
6. The earpiece of headphones is very soft and sweat proof .

These are not the best of the best by any means, they are uncomfortable after half an hour of use and my hair gets tangled and rips out in between the headphone speaker and the head piece almost every time i use them (this is actually the most annoying thing about them).

The studio pro version are just way too expensive. I travel with soundcore Q35s which are bigger but have really good noise cancellation for the money.

BUT, what I didn't like is that there was almost a buzzing due to the noise. I took them off and popped in my Beats Studio Buds. They are much better for mowing and noise cancelling. These are good for listening to quality music in a semi quite environment.

I love them for listening to music, podcasts, and watching shows.

My only complaint is that I wish the padding were a smidge thicker because when I wear stud earrings, they do push in and hurt unless they're on just so.

HeySuzie,4,I like them a lot. Charging is quick and the battery life is good. I like the color. It’s very vibrant. It connects quickly my the first time and every time after. I throw them in my gym bag and I’m not easy with them at all and they held up nicely so far. Very durable. My only issue is my head is on the wider side and they do seem to compress just a tad. All in all it’s pretty good.,"September 26, 2023"

blackkitt,4,"I had a white/silver Beats Solo 2 for 6 or 7 years and loved them. When they finally fell apart for good (I had replaced the cushions and the headband a couple of years before), I wanted the same style. My favorite part is the controls on the ear cup. The pink is gorgeous.

Unfortunately, I find the sound more muddy and boomy, and it's tighter on my ears. I could wear my old Beats for about an hour before my ears started really hurting from the pressure. But these hurt my ears much sooner.

Wireless calling is great, and I'm told the sound on the other end of the call is very good. My older Beats Solo couldn't do that; you needed to plug in a wire.

Fortunately for me, I seldom use headphones for music. If I did, I probably would have reluctantly sent them back. I like to wear these while cooking (or doing something with my hands that doesn't require attention) to listen to podcasts or youtube or other spoken media, and it's fine for that.","May 17, 2023"
Alexa,4,i love them just not for doing sit ups at the gym and ab workouts,"October 4, 2023"
Aida Rivera,4,"I love these they are beautiful nice and sleek. I just wish they were louder. Maybe it’s because I’m Puerto Rican and we like the base to be Loud I honestly was expecting more however, it is doable. I will keep them FYI I hate reading instructions, and if you’re the same way, the volume button is on your left ear just touch about the beats sign to raise the volume and below the beat sign for lowering the volume or you can just do it on your phone, and I will activate the volume on the headset also.","July 30, 2023"
Quinn,4,"The headphones are great when it comes to sound, volume and voice cancellation. I gave it 4-stars due to the fact that these are more so for little kids and people with smaller ears. I don’t have really big ears, they’re average sized. But these headphones are a little too small for them. I wish I would’ve known how they’d fit before purchasing. That’s a mistake on my part for not doing my research first. I ordered these because they are in my price range and I wanted bluetooth headphones. When it comes to the fit of the headphones, it’s more about the pressure that’s applied to the edges of my ears. I have piercings on my flat (antihelix) and my tragus. So for the headphones to consistently apply pressure to those parts, it tends to cause irritation. Tips for anyone with these issues, try covering you ears with the hood of your hoodie and putting the headphones on top that way. Or for the ladies, you can pull your bonnet (whenever you wear it) over your ears and put the headphones on top. That’s what I have to do at times when my ears are irritated. Anything that allows you to cover your ears and put the headphones on top will alleviate the pressure/irritation a lot. It helps a ton. The hoodie trick can be used while at the gym as well. That’s why I bought the headphones to begin with. I have rather oily ears/skin so I feel as though if I bought wireless earbuds (even with the comforters), such as airpods instead that I would lose them just as fast as I bought them. All in all the headphones are good when it comes to price, sound and so on. It’s all about the fitting of the headphones. It’d be a great gift for kids/preteens for sure though. Other than that I have no complaints when it comes to these headphones.","December 15, 2022"

Idk how to review Amazon itself and not the actual product, but I’m documenting this regardless; surely it will be seen. I’m not paying for decent products for them to be damaged by the driver’s carelessness.

Takan,4,Sometimes the headphones will just disconnect out of nowhere and you will be forced to turn them off and on again. This happens at least once per day.

Carla,4,"This is only my second day of usage but I am pleased. I was concerned after reading the reviews, but I'm literally using them now with my TV and they work great imo. Grant it, I'm not an audiophile,maybe I don't have too refined an eardrum, but they sound great to me. Super clear, excellent bass that's adjustable on the app which I love. They could probably be little louder for the teens and twenties that want to blast themselves to kingdom come, but other than that I don't have any complaints yet. Will update if I come across any bugs. I can see how these might be uncomfortable for adults will average size ears because the ear phones are definitely smaller than average. But if you're getting these for a kid, or are an adult with really little ears like me then these are perfect. Other over the ear headphones have been way too big for me, so I would buy cheap child size ones but the volume and quality would be poor. So these are a great find for an adult with small features.
I'll also add the disclaimer that this is the first quality pair of headphones I've purchased, so admittedly I may not have a basis of comparison for judging these. I will say that these are far superior than any $25 -$30 pair I've had before.

Also not sure about the noise cancelling ability of these yet. Probably not on par with other noise cancelling brands like Boise, but those are like $300 and these were under $150 so you get what you pay for on that score I suppose. I love using headphones since I live with others and have a night job and go to bed late, and these are great for my listening purposes.","October 6, 2022"

asb,4,"These headphones work great for listening to music or podcasts. I did not try them while watching a video on my phone. The fit is good too. Nice carry pouch. They feel premium and are worth the cost. However, just be aware that they do come with a slight defect. When on a phone call, the person talking to you starts to hear their own voice echo back. It gets more noticeable if you crank up the volume at your end. I ordered 2 of these and also tested out my friend's Beats Solo3 ordered 3 years ago and they ALL did the same thing. So I am convinced it's a limitation/defect of the product and not just the unit I got. Had to knock off 1 star for that and return the headphones since I was annoying everyone I spoke to by using these :)","February 8, 2023"

aceman,4,"A good replacement for the maxes, cute, comfy and great audio. They have volume controls and a pause button.","July 25, 2023"
Bishop Heahmund,4,"I have mixed feelings about these. The battery life is insanely high. I've never tested it from full to empty but you will charge most other devices multiple times before needing to even think about charging these. The range is the furthest I have ever seen on any bluetooth device, and I can walk almost anywhere in a 2-story house without losing connection.

That being said, as others have mentioned, these can be extremely painful after wearing them for some time. I waited to see if they would break in to write a review since the pain was so much in the beginning. They have broken in some and are less painful but I still get some ear pain after extended use. If not for the ear pain these would be 5 stars for convenience and reliability alone.","February 11, 2023"
Dog Hiker.,4,Good quality sound. Noise cancelling is okay.,"August 15, 2023"
Aubrey,4,"I grew up loving Beats as they were the best of the best back then.. I enjoy using these when I want to listen to music and actually feel the sound..

I bought these specifically for a few flights I planned to take.. I needed something lightweight, and while these are very light they just fit kind of funny and if you have multiple ear piercings it's just super uncomfortable to wear long term.. I don't have a large head but the tightness of these can sometimes be a bother as well as far as the ear pain that comes along with use..

The only other sidebar that bothered me is the fact that the white gets dirty sooo fast. And I guess that's comes with anything white but I still didn't expect it to be that easy to get dirty while also not being as easy to clean..

If you can get past these few issues these headphones are not bad for the price.. I haven't had any sound quality issues or anything like that so they get the job done at the end of the day. Overall I give them a solid 3 to 4 stars..","August 31, 2022"

I have a small head and can wear kids glasses… so lord help the folks with larger sized heads! ;) I have two separate headsets from two different brands that I use for work that never give me this kind of discomfort. For the price, I was surprised they are that uncomfortable. I’ll use them in short bursts, but I think I’ll stick with my AirPods Pro. I had hoped for a nice comfortable, over the ear headset to use at home… but this is not it!","November 8, 2023"
JuliR,3,"Pros - color, sound, audio port (but auxiliary cord has to be bought separately), and prime day price deal

Cons - I found them incredibly uncomfortable. The way the pads sit on my ears was painful, both from the pressure and resting on top of some piercings. I’m a big traveler and having comfy headphones for planes is a necessity. After 1.5 hrs, I couldn’t wear them anymore. [insert sad face]

Also I have a small head and the headband is too big—-but I have this problem with pretty much all adult headphones.

I bought these to replace Boss quiet comfort which I’ve loved, but have now bought over the ear JBLs which I am loving. Just a bummer to also be stuck with these Beats.","November 1, 2023"
imangel0,3,"I bought these as a prime deal figuring, let’s give Beats a try. I have Bose QC that I love but I’ve been wanting to expand my headphone collection to switch it up. Bought these and yeah, I don’t 100% regret it but I prob wouldn’t buy them again. They are cute but they hurt my ears after a bit. Nothing impressive about the sound. Bose is better. I quickly was reaching back for my Bose as my default. I also guess I prefer over ear to on ear. Just better sound and more comfortable. Either save your money or buy Bose instead frfr. The main good thing I can say about these is they charge fast.","November 21, 2023"
Samantha Pines,3,"Common complaint- lousy directions, hardly any instructions- how can you tell how much battery you have- Hold down the 1 button? This turns off or trys to pair. Lights flash- what does that mean? Why not save people going to You Tube for even worse instructions on a video. Right and Left ear pads are not the same- so if you want to enjoy wearing these and say... answer the phone or FF- wear them correctly- the right side ins ONLY to charge and ear area does nothing once on your head. Tiny print on a black background- Get real.","November 5, 2023"
Krystal,3,"I love these headphones. They work awesome when I am trying to work, they cancelled out all the background nose so I can focus better. Now for the part I don't like. I brought these headphones just over a month ago (10/06) and I already need to replace the battery. They would not shut off last night, nor would they turn back on this morning. Of course I tried to update the headphones, do a factory reset, and nothing worked. They just would not turn back on. I suggest for anyone buying these headphones, to make sure you buy an extra battery as well.","November 10, 2023"
HillHC,3,"Ok, look. I’ve bought other mid-level brand On-Ear headphones whenever I found a good sale. I’ve owned JBL, Anker, Plantronics, and Cowans. Even though none of these headphones were disappointing and I wound up handing-them-down to my kids whenever I would find a new deal, I could never walk by the Beats display at the Apple store or Target without trying on a pair. I was convinced that BEATS were the highest quality I would ever justify buying for myself (ok, ok, maybe BOSE too..)

I used to stare up at the night sky, and wish upon a star that someday an insignificant spec like me, floating in the ether and ambiguity of middle-class America, might be blessed or lucky enough to step my audio game up to the big leagues with my own pair of BEATS.

I would stand in the Group 4 boarding line on for my Southwest flights, and gape longingly at the tailored suit wearing, leather duffel carrying, first class yuppies with their BEATS proudly displayed around their necks, and self consciously flip up the collar of my hand me down pea coat to hide the cheapish headphones on my own neck.

Then, Black Friday 2021 arrives, and the Amazon algorithm knew just what would grab my attention… lo, and behold. Beats Solo 3’s for $99?! Had my wish come true? Was there hope for this universe to escape the entropy of heat death? Why, yes, said Amazon. This is your ticket to the big show, sir. You’ve worked hard for your lifestyle. You bought the tailored suit. You bought the leather duffel. You wear the Armani cologne. You have many leather bound books. Your house smells of rich mahogany. There is only one thing you must possess to fully self-actualize, to stand in that boarding line with your head held high, smirking at all those peons with their non-BEATS headphones, paying forward the shame you’ve carried. You, sir, have arrived.

(Ok I’m done with the fluff, here’s the deal. The Beats Solo 3 are an OK pair of headphones. That’s it. The sound isn’t bad, but it isn’t great. If you reread the advertisement, the thing emphasized most is the APPLE chip, which admittedly makes it super easy to connect them to an iPhone but holy hell how hard is it to connect Bluetooth headphones? Is it so difficult that you needed to dumb it down to 1 click instead of 3 clicks?
The battery life is impressive however is on par with other $40-$60 headphones. Also. Um… yo Beats. 2017 called. They’d like their micro-USB charger back.

If the sound were awesome, I’d probably keep them, but only because the logo has swagger, and because when my 15 year old son saw them he was like “Oh wow Dad you got BEATS?!” and (not to get off track) but I desperately want to be the cool, hip dad. (People still say hip right?)

The biggest disappointment, and the reason I will be returning them, is that this pair (for the money, even on Black Friday sale) SHOULD 100% HAVE JUST EVEN A LITTLE NOISE CANCELING, AND SHAME ON BEATS FOR INSINUATING THE EAR CUPS ARE NOISE CANCELLING BECAUSE THAT IS SOME MISLEADING NONSENSE. You know god damn well we want that Active Noise Cancelling, that good good.

IF YOU WANT NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES OR HEADPHONES WITH A MORE THAN MEDIOCRE SOUND QUALITY… I would not recommend springing for these. You can get both from JBL, Anker, Plantronics for less money. Just remember not to take out those headphones until after you’ve walked through first class, you proletariat cog.

dαrcy,3,"Good sound, nice design but a little over hyped? For the price I’d think they would be more comfortable too. They sit right on your ear, so there’s no space or comfort, and your ears are squished :( This was a deal breaker for me - my head and ears are sensitive to pressure and they were just painful to wear. They now belong to my roommate who loves them 😂","November 30, 2023"
Zachary,3,"Part of the reason I purchased these is because they’re advertised to have up to a 40 hour listening period. I charged them to 100%, I’ve been listening to music for not even an hour, and they’re already down by 20%. I’m no math genius or anything but I know good and well these won’t last anywhere near 40 hours. I should’ve known that was too good to be true.","November 29, 2023"
andi,3,"Not a bad product but I definitely expected much more for the price, this is my first pair of Beats. I have a 10 year old pair of noise cancelling Bose BT headphones I was replacing and thought for sure based on other reviews these would be awesome, I've also had really fantastic Sony BT noise cancelling headphones that were equally impressive. Unfortunately, I find these Beats headphones lacking in several areas for the price. I wouldn't categorize these as ""noise cancelling"" they simply muffle ambient sound. The sound quality is merely on point with headphones half the price, definitely not the depth and clarity of sound my old Bose/Sony provide which is my greatest disappointment. The ear pads are on the smaller side and could be softer to mold to your ears as my Bose and Sony did potentially blocking ambient sound better and feeling more comfortable. The color and materials are nice and what I would expect for the price, yet the fit of the headphones is a bit too snug and they have a greater tendency to slip off my ears if I am moving much or tilting my head forward, but they would probably work well for someone under 13 years old. Overall, these headphones look cool but the sound quality and fit is definitely disappointing.","August 1, 2023"
Jenny,3,"Sounds good, the pads are too small and hard and they hurt my ears though, I don't listen to music on them for very long periods of time. I wish there was an option anywhere for them to be bigger, but there are zero replacements that aren't the exact same size!","November 30, 2023"
Alyssa,3,"I had to give this three stars. As wonderful as the sound quality was, there are just too many drawbacks for me to be able to leave a better rating. For context, I decided to give these a try because I needed a pair of headphones I could wear with my current pair of glasses. My old Bose pair goes around and presses the earpieces directly into the side of my head--which, after a while, starts to really, really hurt. I thought maybe a pair of on-ear headphones would fix that. T'was not so.

These hurt to even put on, much less wear for any length of time. They were too tight around my head, so much so I felt like my head had been stuck in a vice. Because of this, they pressed really hard against my ears. Not just against the tops of my ears where my glasses sit, but everywhere, especially against the harder cartilage. I couldn't wear these for ten minutes, honestly.

As stated in the headline, would not recommend these if you have 1) a large head, 2) glasses, or 3) any sort of piercing. Sorry, Beats. You're not for me.","September 19, 2023"

Amazon Customer,3,"You might be ahead to invest in their high tier headphones, which I haven't heard. Compared to my studio headphones these don't hold up. But for the black Friday price they'll do.","November 25, 2023"
Eric,3,"The size and fit of the headphones is accurate in all the other reviews. If you’re coming from the original Beats Solo, these are not the same fit or listening experience.

1) The ear cushions are smaller vs. the original. They are also firmer (read: harder) than the original. They WILL hurt your ears for average to larger ear lobes. I use them in bed when laying down, which helps some. I only listen for about an hour or hour and a half, and my ears are pretty tender after.

*If your original Beats Solo still works but the padding and material is damaged for the ear cushions, just order replacements here on Amazon. Trust me. See next point.

2) If you’re not someone who consistently uses subwoofers and high bass on their home or car stereo systems, you will be extremely shocked how much bass comes through. You can’t even hear the lyrics on many newer songs. They vibrate your ears and makes them itchy. I have to use the reduce base feature on my phone to make it at least an acceptable level to me, and even then it’s sometimes too much.

*The base level will vary highly on your preference. Just know that you won’t be missing it here.

If you still have the original Beats Solo and just need replacement cushions, or you’re thinking about a upgrade, this is not an upgrade. Keep it if it still works.

And listen to some other product suggestions on some of the reviews here. Your paying for the name and some Apple features when it comes to these, but there are many better options out there for reduced costs.

However, if you’re adamant about these, they fit on tight to your ears for the gym. It is just that your muscles won’t be the only thing sore after the work out.","March 28, 2023"

Amazon Customer,3,"So the sound quality on these headphones are actually top notch. Not that I'm any expert but I do love listening to music, and the music sounds soooo good! BUT these weren't comfortable to wear at all. Like not in the slightest. They were so unnecessarily tight, and squeezed my head something akin to popping a pimple. I've never had this problem before with headphones so this was really disappointing. There wasn't a way I could tell to widen the band without breaking them, so I have to return them because what's the point of having headphones that are uncomfortable to wear.","October 18, 2023"

Jonny Diligent,3,"If you knew me you would know two things, I live in my headphones and second im not an apple fan although i own an use their products every day. I never buy things because the name or hype especially headphones. Because i use them so much i usually just get some $30 over ear Bluetooth than usually last six or more months than i buy a new budget pair when they break. However since i been making some ok money and im addicted to online shopping i began to look at some brand name headphones. After looking at multiple top 5 lists for bluetooth headphones i noticed beats never made the lists. How can this be? Almost all of my clients that wear over ear headphones always have beats. I see them everywhere. Well since the top 3 where bose or sony’s that average $250-$300. This was a drastic leap for me so i figured i’d go halfway and see how much i like the upgrade before i make the jump. So when i came across beats solo 3 for only $129 i was curious. They certainly are pretty, slimmer than my usual, a plus an most of all 3hrs play off only 5 min charge i’m sold. Finally i will have some drip to my headphone game. I got excited.
They came quick. First thing i noticed was how clean there design is, seem solid i like thefeel of the click when you unfold the hinges nice an beefy not at all flimsy. I was bummed that they use a micro usb and not a usb c. I put them on an a little tight feeling the pad diameter is a little small but again pretty. Super disappointed in the sound it is very clear but not loud at all. I mean after years of $30 headphones that drop i keep wanting to put them away and listen to my old pair so i can feel some bass. Than they died no problem let me charge for 5 min and i will get another 3hrs. Bull $&@“ i had to let them sit on the charger but worst of all after a day my ear cartalidge is sore as @&$?. Not a fan at all","July 19, 2022"

Romelia Arreaga,3,"The headphone quality and sound are great! They are amazing because they do their job and it is not that expensive like most wireless headphones. The main reason why I returned them is because they are not comfortable. I thought maybe as I wore them more I'll get used to them but no that wasn't my case. My ears after using them felt a lot of pressure and it hurt for a while. I am now using the Beats Studio 3 and they are way better, I 100% recommend them. Overall, these headphones are great but just not the comfiest.","September 19, 2023"

Rain City Native,3,"I like these. Nice clear sound and good noise cancelling. I wasn't wowed by the sound quality, but in all fairness, they don't fit that well with my smaller head size. The headphones sink down a little too low so they don't quite cover my ear as they should, and they put pressure on my jaw.

Also, I can't wear my glasses with them, they squish the frame temples. Which might be the case with all headphones. This is the first pair I've tried.

I think they have a mic as well for taking phone calls. For the price they're excellent over all, sadly just not for people with smaller heads.","August 5, 2023"

NRHTX,3,"AMAZING headphones. In other words, when I bought the Solo 3 wireless headphones, they were killing my ear canal. I tried to get used to them for about 2 weeks without luck.

The Solo 3 is wireless are good. I am in meetings all day and working from home and I can hear the other person perfectly and the sound quality is great.

I had to return the Solo 3s back because they were killing my ear collage a lot. I gave them a try for almost 2 weeks and I could not handle the pain. I decided to switch to Studio 3 wireless and WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE it was.

Update as of Feb 6, 2023. I had the Beats Studio 3s for about 4 weeks. The ear pain was not as bad as the Solo's. But I was constantly having issues with the ANC and switching between my Windows 10/11 to my Android Pixel 6 phone was difficult. Meaning, If I disconnected from the PC to my Pixel 6 I could not connect at all.

I decided to pay extra and purchased the Sony EH-1000XM5
Wow these are super light and when I first put them on. I was in heaven, without paying any sound my wife walked into my office and I had no idea she was there. The ANC on the sony wh-1000xm5 are wicked awesome. Switching between my PC and Android is so quick and smooth. The sound quality is also amazing and the extra features beat the Beats","January 16, 2023"
Michael T.,3,These are adequate for an inexpensive pair of headphones. Sometimes the sound fades out of one side of another when using it in the wireless mode. If you have a larger than average head you may find them a bit uncomfortable to wear. I think it’s a great gift for a child 12 and up for a first headphone set.,"September 7, 2023"
Ileana Collazo,3,To buy this headset for the first time I can say for me they dint work like I thought they would. I still can hear people around me wen I am in the gym or walking outside.

Amber,3,Decent sound overall which I liked. Noise cancelling works great. I was just disappointed with how bass sounds.

Kevin Zheng,3,These headphones have good sound quality and fairly comfortable. However where it struggles is if you listen to music over 30-50% volume the sound leaks like crazy to the point where your a walking speaker. This is an issue in public areas such as the gym. I stopped wearing these at the gym due to that reason and only use them when I am at home.,"August 6, 2023"
SuperChef,3,"Based on the other reviews, I'm pretty sure these are legit. Although I am a Prime member so everything I order with prime comes directly from Amazon and not some random individual who sells stuff on Amazon.

The sound quality is good, the nose cancelation is good, over all a good set of headphones if you just plan on listening to music and just chilling.

I'm a active gym goer so I'm sweating heavy about 6 days a week. And at my gym I've seen tons of people using these beats solos as their workout headphones.. They're dumb and I fell for the marketing of beats. I always thought they were over hyped and priced. I snagged these for about $150 and would never pay $200+ just to have that lil b logo on my head.

Anyways the sound quality is good and they were comfortable on my first 1 1/2 workout. It was until I was about to get into the sauna.

I thought about it, are these going to get eff'd up with the excess sweat and heat? I looked it up and to my surprise these headphones are not even sweat proof, actually they're not even advertised as any type of workout headphones.

This kinda shocked me since I've seen so many people with them at my gym so I just assumed they were ideally for working out, that's my fault for not checking.

So I will be returning these because I'm sure after a month of gym and sauna use these mfs are going to fall apart.","January 9, 2022"

But then, if I pause the video on the computer for a couple of mins and play it again, the video starts playing immediately on my computer. But it takes about 8-10 secs to hear the audio on Beats Solo3 wireless headset (while connected through BlueTooth). It is really frustrating as I listen to online lecture videos, and I have to pause to take notes. When I play it again, it takes 8-10 secs to hear the audio. I have to rewind for 10 secs and play again after I hear the audio..","February 12, 2023"

karen elisabeth,3,"These were on sale, I really wanted to like them, but I just can’t! The sound quality is muffled and treble-y, no bass. Also, because the ear pads are so small (and I have tiny ears), the depth and range of sound is significantly diminished as opposed to true over-the-ear headphones. These sit on your ears (not around) and don’t envelope you in music. And the increasing volume did not help. I want to be immersed in the music and these headphones were muffled, uncomfortable, and distracting. Many other products out there with better sound quality and fit.","April 3, 2023"

Taylor,3,Even tho these headphones are super comfortable and perfect for the gym I do wish they were louder. On the plus side tho they do block out outside noise so that’s a plus but I still wish the volume went higher. Just a personal preference but if you’re not looking for something that will super loud these are perfect because the sound quality is amazing. I do wish they went a little smaller as well because even on the smallest they’re a little large for my head. Overall a good pair of headphones tho,"May 1, 2023"
Bradley French,3,"I was hoping for alot more out of these head phones since I wanted to use them for the gym. The sound quality is pretty good but the max volume is lacking, the noise cancellation isn’t 100%, and the size of the headphones aren’t big enough to cover an adult ear, probably a good buy for a child or pre teen.

The most annoying part of all of this is the return process, rather than dropping them off at a UPS store like a usual return, you have to repackage and print a return label then be there in person when the UPS drives arrives which is not set with an appointment, you have 3 chances to miss the driver before the return is canceled and there doesnt seem to be a way to cancel the return to select another shipping method before then.","January 5, 2023"

If ANC doesn’t factor into whether you buy headphones or not , These beats have a decent build quality and great sound.

I wanted head phones and no ear buds and that's why I thought get a new pair so when I run or work out I am not consistently messing with them. I can hear the treadmill over the beats and that's with them maxed.
Very disappointed.","December 1, 2023"
Trevor,2,"Coming from a pair of Sony MDR XB950BT's, these are a huge step backwards. I am admittedly a basshead and was expecting more bass from a headphone with the name beats, but these don't have half the bass of the sonys even when they had the bass boost turned off. On top of that, the sound quality is about what I'd expect from a pair of $50 headphones. These are unimpressive on every level. Not very comfortable, average sound at best, and lacking on the low end. The Sony cans were better in every category and were at the same price point and from around the same era I believe. If they weren't discontinued, I would've bought another pair. Within an hour of using these beats, I ordered a pair of skullcandy ANC 2's to satisfy my desire for more low end. If you're looking for bass, these aren't it, and if you want sound quality, look elsewhere as well.","September 14, 2023"
Gloriana,2,"returned these headphones. the are cute, feel like semi good quality and are comfortable. they don’t slide off or fall off which is nice and are easy to adjust. the button controls are quite clicky so you can feel the pressure on your ears. HOWEVER… the battery life is abysmal, and so is the sound quality. these went down 10% in 10 minutes just listening to music… and the volume doesn't get very loud at all, and there’s a good amount of sound leakage. also, these are NOT NOISE CANCELLING AT ALL. for the price, i expected a lot better.","November 27, 2023"

Then I found a bunch of other peoples' questions about the same thing! The way to check the ear for free requires ungluing the whole foam part--so I have to maim my almost $200 headphones now. I looked up getting a repair at apple and the quote is $130 because I don't have apple care. It's $30 with apple care, so if you still want these, get them through apple so the repair won't be much. I'm not a tech/wire-versed person, so I will probably end up having to buy another pair, which is infuriating, because I may as well have bought more expensive Bose headphones in the first place for what I'll have now paid for one pair of beats that works for more than 4 months. Not a great purchase with the limited lifespan in mind.","February 28, 2023"
Jade,2,"These definitely look, feel, and sound high quality. And I've heard the battery life is usually very long, however the ones I received do not last for more than 2 hours without having to recharge. And if I leave them unplugged overnight, they're dead again by morning.
I know I'm turning them of properly, and I've only had them for a week so it's not normal wear on the battery.","October 19, 2023"
Eli,2,"I thought with beats I will drop my shoes…. Nope. I like listen to intense music like trash metal and these just don’t cut it

Wonda237,2,These are amazing with the looks and the sound . I love them but i did only give them 2 stars cause they kill my ears!! I have to keep moving them around to let up pressure idk what to do about that. Anyone have any ideas?!!,"October 26, 2023"
Kate,2,"These are probably my least favorite headphones I’ve ever purchased. The only good thing about them is their battery life. Sound isn’t the best on the market for this price range that’s for sure. I was hoping for a heavier bass. The design of these headphones are best for people with very short hair or for those who wear their hair up, just taking them off rips hair every time even if I’ve just been on my couch drawing for a few hours. To add, my ears always hurt after using these. I don’t have that large of a head but the pressure gave me a headache. I will say I’ve purchased Bluetooth beats before, not the over the ear type, the ones connected by a small cord, and those are AMAZING. Was super bummed about these! I’m going to continue to use them because I did not just waste 100$..","May 29, 2023"
M. J. Greene,2,"Mine failed (fortunately) a week before the warranty expired. Had to jump through hoops with Apple to get them replaced after they initially denied me service. It was a huge pain in the butt and very frustrating. Right head phone suddenly stopped working and it was a short. Did some online research and sure enough it's a known problem that Apple keeps denying. Usually happens just outside of the warranty period - surprise, surprise. I use mine primarily to listen to music while working out and for the occasional hands-free phone call. I'm guessing that I used mine for 250-280 hrs over the course of 50 weeks before failure. I'm guessing that my replacement will last about the same. Another issue is the charging cord is about 6 inches long and its difficult to plug in. Sound is great although volume control on headset is too sensitive. Not recommended.","July 3, 2023"
Ralf,2,"These work find but are very uncomfortable. The hurt even after a short time. They also hurt the top of my head - when I adjust them so they don't hurt my head they hurt my ears and vice versa.

MAC,2,"These are good for listening to podcasts, but they’re not great for music. They have limited volume range and the ear cups are really small so your ears get very sweaty and your earlobes are compressed. This impacts long-term comfort if you’re wearing them over time.","October 19, 2023"
Positive P++,2,"Play Video
 I was so excited to use these to work out, and I should’ve done my research prior to buying them, my friends warned me, but I still wanted them because they were pink Lol., however I saw I was working out in the gym. I could still hear the gym music even while playing my music there’s not really a lot of bass so you’re better off getting the studios like I was told if you really want that thump","November 26, 2023"
Samara B.,2,I bought the product a little while ago and it worked for about two months and while at the gym the left side completely went out. I tried reusing them after quite some time and they’re definitely done for. They were my favorite too🙁,"October 20, 2023"
Lindsey McDonald,2,"Smaller fit than regular beats. These fit my toddler. For real, my dad gave them to my 3 year old.","December 4, 2023"
Aman,2,"Honestly beats headphones have always been more about the brand than the actual headphones which I never truly realized till buying a pair. Not only were they disappointing in sound quality but build quality as well. For the money you pay, I’d expect something a bit more solid and sturdy and definitely would expect it to sound much better. Overalls these are definitely not BAD headphones but also not great. If these were $50 I’d say it’s worth it but definitely not over $100. I have a pair of $75 Sony headphones with ANC and ambient mode that are much better than these Beats Solo 3s, and the beats were supposed to be the upgrade lol. Additionally the clamping force is a bit much on these especially with the on ear design so beware because after a few minutes it does cause a noticeable discomfort on the outer edges of your ears. I will be returning these and maybe trying the Beats Studio 3s which I have more hopes for. If you aren’t super picky and just want a pair of beats these could be for you, but if you are expecting a pair of “nice” headphones I’d look elsewhere.","February 20, 2023"

Hard Working Mom,2,"I would love to recommend these, but I just can’t. I own several Beats earphones as well as AirPods , but these particular ones do not have the volume or sound quality I expect from an Apple/Beats item. The sound quality is poor, and these are NOT noise canceling. I suggest that you put out the money and purchase either Beats earbuds or AirPods Pro, where you will get quality sound.","September 17, 2023"
rebecca cohen,2,"I had high hopes for this headset, as this is the 2nd pair from this brand that I’ve returned. I first bought the ones you put in your ear, and those were awful and now this set had the worst sounds. Apparently you need to spend $300 w this brand to get good sound or go w a different brand. I would never purchase from this brand again","August 30, 2023"
Ilya Storozhev,2,"3 days before the expiration of the warranty period, they stopped working. we were able to change it only when contacting the apple store, with the support of amzon. after 2 hours of negotiations, they were sent to the apple store, and 10 days later they received new ones instead of the old ones and without a box.","September 9, 2023"

Eric,2,Mine didn't come with the 3.5mm remotetalk cable listed in the description. I don't know if that means it's not actually new or what... disappointing. The headphones are okay but not really any better than a set of $30 Sony wireless headphones. They really push installing the beats app but all you can do on there is locate your headphones.,"September 17, 2023"
Emily Wright,2,"First off, they’re small. I have small ears and a small head, and they’re small. At least smaller than I expected. They almost look like kids headphones. The sound is decent but not good enough for the price point. Maybe some people love these, but definitely not for me. An immediate return :/","October 12, 2023"
Andre Wynter,2,It’s great to block out the noise but when you are using it as a headphone for your phone it’s horrible. You can hear the person but the person on the other line can barely hear you. It sounds like you are a mile away. Great for music horrible to talk over.,"October 3, 2023"

Anlis O.,2,"I was excited for this headphones especially since I got them for a great price on Prime Day… what a disappointment. This one was going to be the replacement for the same model I previously purchased about two years ago. Material was noticeably different, this one was made of a cheaper plastic material compared to the older one. Sound and microphone was not the best specially during a phone call, the person on the other end was not able to hear me clearly and my voice sounded distant. Not recommended.","August 4, 2023"
Whitney R Newton,2,"Love the color, the fit, and the noise cancellation. The cushioned ear pieces are super soft, and it doesn’t squeeze my glasses.

Battery is an issue. I bought these for my bday in Oct 2022. Recently at the gym, I couldn’t get them to connect to my iPhone and figured battery was dead. Once I got home and plugged them in, it showed 55% battery. Today i plugged them in while getting ready to go. When I leave, I have the same issue with connecting to iPhone. Finally connects and shows the 55% battery. Within 5 mins, they shut off completely and while half the lights flash, indicating half charge, it doesn’t stay on. Googled and apparently there’s a known issue with Beats not stay on under 55%.

I also noticed coming back here that a charging cable is shown, and I did not receive that in my package.","February 3, 2023"
In GA,2,"Headphones are extremely temperamental. They quit charging, and then decided they would charge again, and now are back to not charging. When I try to charge them, I get three of the four lights lit, but they will not turn on.

Jaleesa,2,How is not noise cancellation a thing in all headphone in 2023? It’s a cute red tho!,"September 28, 2023"
Nina,2,"Cons:
The fit is awful. I saw a lot of people warning of the fit saying that it was much tighter than they had anticipated and I became one of those people. They're not just tight, they're *very* tight. The sound quality itself when they're resting on your head is worse than my $40 Bluetooth ear buds that I bought years ago. They're already so tight but they don't sound remotely good until you press them even harder against your head. I also feel like they don't get very loud at all and considering they aren't truly noise canceling, that's a problem for me.

Pros:
The sound when it's smashed into your brain is nice (again, awful when you don't). They look cool. They connect easily. The folding is convenient and not a challenge. Changing the volume is easy.

If these were priced at $40, I would say okay, *maybe* I would consider keeping them. Even at $45 I would say they're overpriced, so obviously I found their actual cost so wildly overpriced that I returned them. Truly shocked that they have such high ratings and I believe it's people trying to convince themselves they're good headphones because they cost so much and that's the only way to live with their buyer's remorse.","April 10, 2022"
JaiceyMarie,2,"I really liked how great they looked and how easy it was to pair them to my phone. However, it’s my first day wearing them and within an hour my ears hurt.

Alethia Cutting,2,You won’t get something that will last long. These headphones were not only super tight on the head to the point of discomfort they are not durable at all. I got mine in September and after 3 months it snapped on side and just today the other side snapped. They are also not sound proof other people will hear your music if you turn the sound above 50% and at 50% if your trying to block others out YOU still will hear THEM honestly your better off investing in more expensive headphones or go with Sony they have cheaper and better quality headphones. Hopes this helps don’t fall for the trap,"February 27, 2023"

Chris,2,"I’ve been using them for a few months. For me buying these was a mistake. They would be acceptable at half the price. Battery life is good. And the sound is acceptable. The issue is a lot of small things. I find them uncomfortable to wear for more than a short period of time, and they slip off my head if I am moving around. The hinge is constantly pulling at my hair. They don’t make a sound when they power on so I find myself taking them off to check. This is exacerbated by the fact they are the slowest of my Bluetooth devices to connect to my iPhone. That one is inexcusable, since they are made by apple. Some cheap Bluetooth headphone pair nearly instantly, yet these are sluggish.","January 3, 2023"
Liefmon14,2,"They worked extremely well, good quality always like beats but the pair I got barely lasted half an hour.

Amber,2,"After waiting over a month for these to arrive, they finally did! I tried them on and they are actually quite comfortable - I didn't have the issue with them hurting my ears. However, the headphones would not turn on. I thought maybe they needed to be charged first, so I plugged them in using the charger provided. Still wouldn't turn on. I gave it a quick Google and apparently this is a known issue with the Solo 3's. I performed the restart that the Apple website mentions (holding the volume down and power buttons at the same time for 10-15secs), and still nothing. There are many videos out there of people fixing the power button, but if I spend $100 on brand new headphones, I shouldn't have to take them apart and fix them. They should just work.","November 7, 2022"

Evelyn Vargas,2,"I returned them. The color was on point for me. The sound was OK. The reason why I returned them was because they're so heavy. Within 10 minutes, your ears are sore.

Maicokid,2,"These were right around 100 bucks I believe Beats Solo3. Had difficulty on numerous networks getting it to hold its connection with Bluetooth. It even play for a half an hour, then suddenly quit and then I’d have to reset it again to do it directions were minimal and I could not get the volume to work because those were confusing instructions with respect to which side of the device Figured it out but they look very similar. In any case, the volume did not work, I would consider other options.","January 29, 2023"
Simone,2,"Apparently my head is too large for these. As a Gen-Xer I was pretty sure my noggin was smaller than Dr Dre's but apparently not small enough. I have no problem with their function or sound quality but pretty much un-useable due to tightness on my head. Think I might leave them on a watermelon for a week and see if they will get any more comfy.

Todd M. O'Connor,2,"I bought these headphones for a trip I was taking that I was going to be flying for 8 hours or so and was really excited to be splurging on a pair of Beats Headphones. They look fantastic, super sharp design. They sound great as well. Honestly great sound, crisp like a fresh dollar bill. Battery life was nuclear; I used them for a solid amount of time and they were still well charged. There is no notable noise cancellation, this didn't make no nevermind as they are not advertised as such. The issue with the headphones is the physical size. I am an average sized adult male with an average sized head and ears. After about 30 minutes of my head and ears being in this vice-grip with my ears being crushed, the pain was just awful. The earpads are tiny, and these suckers are tight like a tiger. Now, if you are a small child, or a grown adult who happens to have a head that is physically the size of a small child, or you maybe just don't actually have ears on the sides of your head because you lost them or never had actual external ears, these would be the perfect headphones for you.","April 29, 2021"

Dwayne,2,"I was really excited about purchasing and owning my first pair of Beats headphones. I have heard great things about the product line and had managed to get enough money to purchase the Beats Solo 3 pair. I was greatly disappointed after experiencing excruciating pain on both ears after wearing these headphones after 2 hours of usage each day. I have been working from home since the pandemic started and often I need to use Zoom a lot to communicate with my coworkers. So a good pair of headphones with a mic is what I needed for voice chat. While the sound quality and battery life of these headphones, as other reviewers have mentioned, were great those good features negated my overall experience and enjoyment of these headphones. I could not bare the pain anymore that I experienced from wearing these and so decided to return back to Amazon for a refund and continue looking for headphones that not only have good sound quality and battery life, but comfort as well when wearing them. Sorry Beats, I have to give you 2 stars for this. The only reason why I am not giving 1 star is because of the good sound quality and battery life.","September 22, 2020"

jclville,1,"Don't get these. I seriously thought only the wealthy and rich would own beats. But on Prime Day with 50%, I thought nows my chance to own something I think I'll love and have heard of and made by no e other then Doctor Dre. I don't care what anyone says, there is no way on earth Doctor Dre would wear these, and if he does then I somehow missed the fact that his has unbelievable tiny little ears that arent being squished to death and painful and annoying within 10 minutes. Maybe newer models are better. Was super excited, paired them and started watching my favorite YouTube. I never thought 10 minutes in I'd be pausing it to take them off and not make it thru a 20 minute video. I have some that cost far far less that I purchased before I knew I'd take the leap for the big dog brand And now I know that's all it is. They hurt and on top of that I was waiting for I guess the crystal clear sound, smooth bass, and just amazing audio til I realized these were much WORSE then the other pair that was a fraction of the price. And in sound and comfort. So disappointed. I don't leave reviews much, and thid is a family account so there are reviews from different members for different things.But I had to leave one for this after the disappointment just like I'm going to leave one for the soundcore ones I got that blow these out of the water. I felt these were less then average in every way. If I had to find something good to say about them it would be that it came with lots of packaging and a nice little case and carabineer to clip them into z bag or something. So if I bought them for those little things I guess I'd like them but I was after decent or even better then decent headphones and even offering them to my spouse, they said they felt great on them. I waited. Not even 5 minutes later she took them off saying they were hurting her ears and nothing special about the sound. I know she wanted them to feel great and work great because of the brand. But less then average 🎧 that u actually spend a good bit on to hurt instead of feel nice or have a nice quality sound ain't worth any brand. Careful of other reviews too. Look at review sites and it seems to be the common opinion. I like Polo shirts. But I don't force myself into a plain Polo shirt that's 5 sizes to small and wear it anyways just because it's Polo.","July 17, 2023"
Brittani Lucio,1,"These were on sale for cyber Monday, so I jumped on the deal without really researching the earphones. I had been in the market for some new ones and I’ve always heard beats were really good. I was super excited to get them and after getting them charged up I put them on and they were pretty uncomfortable. I decided to wait a while to see if it was just an initial thing of my ears getting used to it, but after an hour, they were unbearable. I have never had earphones feel this uncomfortable and painful in my life. Absolutely disappointed for the price of these, even with the sale price definitely not worth it. I also hated that there wasn’t a “next” button for the music. If I wanted to change the song, I would have to ask siri to go to the next track which got super annoying.","November 30, 2023"
HighMileageFeets,1,"Don't buy if android user. The description OMITS to tell you these headsets won't connect directly to your phone, but it requires you to install an ad saturated app first. So you have to use up your data and clutter up your phone with another useless app. It is hard to ID in the playstore because the logo on the headset and the logo on the app look completely different. Also there are manys ""beats"" apps. It wants permission to take pictures and videos? Does this headset have a secret camera somewhere? The app contains ads and wants you to set up a profile and have followers. The beats app is about the stupidest thing I have ever seen. I DON'T WANT FOLLOWERS FOR A HEADSET!! I just want to listen to MY music and books! What kind of vain rich useless airheaded twit wants people to follow their brand of headset? (Maybe I should get a toilet paper app and get some wipey followers on that too!) Plus I just paid $$$ for this headset so they could advertise to me! The packaging is inappropriate. We are in a recession, a pandemic, the enviroment is going to pot and you are packing up a set of freaking headphones like they are a precious newborn baby. There is even a fancy sticker. All that is missing is the gold leaf coating! I am pretty sure the first $100 dollars is for the cost of the fancy 3 layers of thick boxes these things come in! There is even a special place for the tiny carabiner. It is sickening that this elaborate packaging is all for 10 seconds of visual impression before it gets pulled apart and tossed away. I am a very hardworking person that has to watch my money. I bought these on sale. These headphones were a glimpse into a world of middle and upper class indulgence I rarely see. But that glimpse has really disgusted me.
As a final thought: I walk and drive in places with no service. Since this headset only works through an app, I suspect it will be useless to take on long walks or camping in the woods where there is no cell service. So my beloved well used (until they fell apart) $20 headset is superior to these overpriced status symbols.
Addendum: After all that fanfare and $$$, they are defective. They turn themselves off every 15 minutes. I tried to get help from apple and they took my information and hung up on me. Amazon tech support helped me to reset them, but it didn't fix the problem. Maybe I should throw the headset out and listen with the fancy box? It would probably work better!","December 1, 2020"
a,1,"Bought on Black Friday, it didn’t work or charge after just taking out of the box. And I had to call Amazon who said they would only refund not replace, and said to call Apple. Talked to the first person and said that there wasn’t a guarantee it would be replaced but that we could go to an Apple Store and get it repaired and then somehow the call got disconnected so we had to start all over. Then we were told we were not guaranteed a new one only a refurbished one. We waisted 2 1/2 hours of our time at the end.","November 29, 2023"

SB,1,I bought these half off and they wouldn’t be worth the price at 90% off. I have a pair of Beats from 6 years ago that put these to shame. The new ones at full volume didn’t get 2/3 as loud as the old ones. No charger. Crap tote bag. I guess now that Dre is a billionaire he doesn’t mind screwing hard working people forking out hard earned $$$ for a product nowhere near as good as it used to be.

Amanda E.,1,"I ordered these for my son at Christmas when they were on sale for $99.00 and there was no warranty offered. Return or replace date was January 31, 2023. The headphones broke in September, wouldn't turn on. Upon calling the manufacturer, Beats, I was told to contact the seller because the headphones were less than a year old. I tried to reach Amazon, and customer service denied my request for a replacement immediately and told me to call the manufacturer. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor then said, ""I'll make an exception for you. Return them and your money will be refunded."" It made me so upset, because that means my son won't have headphones anymore because they're no longer on sale. So, they were picked up by UPS however I have yet to be refunded my money!!! The headphones went back, but I'm out and there's nothing I can do!! What a ripoff. Amazon shame on you.","September 10, 2023"
MP,1,"These were great while they lasted. Used for about 15 hours then the power indicator LED lights stopped working. The headphones still worked for a few more uses. Now they work for about 10 minutes then they turn off without warning.

My recommendation is chose a different brand and save yourself the headache.","December 9, 2023"
T. Allen,1,"UPDATE: turns out this problem is very common, suggesting how truly poor Beats has become. Google it, you'll find dozens of YouTube videos on how to fix this very-shoddy wiring. If you don't have a soldering iron or aren't familiar with fixing circuit boards, then DO NOT BUY. Beats has become terrible.

These headphones have been phenomenal, great sound & range, long life on a single charge. Until now. I've has these just under one year, and they spend 90% of their time lying on my desk or on my head, almost nothing else. Then suddenly the right ear is completely out unless I slightly twist the left ear in either direction, indicating a nearly-disconnected wire. They've NEVER been dropped, twisted, or roughly handled whatsoever. And now this, out of the blue.

M.X.V,1,"I was looking for a qualitied, cute headphone for myself so that I could focus on my art stuff while I listen to music. I wanted a headphone that would last and since this one wasn't cheap I thought it'd do the trick. And it was also cute like I wanted. I was so excited for it when it came after a couple days and used it immediately. I loved the sound quality and the design was so cute with the pink! I also love it because it connected to both my phone and laptop! But one day when I put it on while working on my drawings and writing, I couldn't hear the music from the right side. So, I turned the headphone off and on and connected again, but the same issue persisted. It's been more than 2 weeks now since I couldn't hear anything from the right side. It's so frustrating because it has only been 4 months (bought mid to end of June) since I got this and I thought it would work until at least another one or 2 years! Now, it seems like the headphone stopped working altogether as it isn't even connecting to my phone at all. My old headphone for 50 bucks lasted much longer than this, and I got this headphone for doubled that price at ~$163!! I was going to buy another headphone for my niece for Christmas, but now I'm better off looking and spending my money somehwere else that's worth it more!","October 31, 2022"

They’re completely useless. Not only was sound quality not as good as AirPods, but they constantly would almost fall off my head with any bending over movements at the gym and I had it the tightest/smallest it could go.

Debra Metzger,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE BEATS HEADPHONES - THEY'RE CRAP! EVERY set of Beats Over Ear headphones I have purchased have broken down (STOPPED PRODUCING SOUND) in less than 1 year. My current pair, in 4 months! And the charging ""hole"" breaks down swiftly too, so you cannot charge them. I have three pairs. Like an idiot I just keep buying them because they're great initially but, they keep breaking down, so I am essentially just throwing money at this OVERRATED company's product. My headphones are treated gently, when I work-out I put absorbent hair scrunchies between the ear cups and my ears to prevent them from getting wet. The product is essentially crap, and the company (warrantee desk) does not stand behind their product. Example: First pair that stopped producing sound, they exchanged it for a ""new pair"" (likely not new, based on what happened next). Four months later, the ""new"" pair stopped producing sound. SAME ISSUE. I called the warrantee desk, and they refuse to replace my four-month old pair they just sent to me! I now have two pair of broken-down beats headphones. I also have a third ""pink"" pair I anticipate will be breaking down any time soon. I get much better life out of inexpensive headphones I purchase at Marshalls or TJ Maxx. Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY with Beats Headphones. They're great at first, but they all break down within one year! BUYER BEWARE!","July 25, 2022"

I asked to get sent new ones and within 2 months, the same thing.
I take very good care of them; I always have them in the case if not in use and even after use I wipe them down with tissue just in case. How insane!!

Ashley Royce,1,"Initially I really liked these headphones but recently they've started to disconnect pretty often. I though it might have to do with battery since it was just happening at low battery but it did it again today at full battery. I know it isn't because it's trying to communicate with too many devices, this only happens at work where the only device it knows is my phone. Just disappointing that these cost the amount they do but they can't stay connected for more than a few hours

Edit:
Its happening everywhere now multiple times a day. I have to disconnect them and reconnect them to get them to work again. They do this primarily for audio so its super fun at work if my phone's audio is on. Never buying another beats product again. Ive never had this issue with cheap headphones.","July 11, 2023"
Felix De La Rosa,1,"I have never felt so disappointed by a product. you buy this product and you expect them to be “Beats”, by this i mean good build quality and good audio quality, but to keep it real, the audio quality is good yet not what someone would expect, the lack bass and volume no matter the setting or platform (except instagram, its literally only platform were they sound what you expect them to sound), also they get uncomfortable after like 10 minutes of use because they are very tight (this is to prevent noise leak, yet they still leak) but its too tight for me, and third and most important reason not to buy these garbage headphones, right side stopped working in about 3 months of use, (used them these morning and when i came came from work, then i just shut them down to hace a nap, i placed them on the table, after i woke up tried using them and right side doesn't sound any more, tried re-setting and all that and no result), when i got these i was so hyped, i remember the nice unboxing experience, but guys, trust me on this one, most of the reviews are about the fact that they dont live up to the hype and dont fulfill customers expectations on the sound quality, but the sound is ok, but the real reason not to buy these is the life expectancy… DO NOT BUY!!!, trust me DO NOT BUY!!!!","January 5, 2022"
Don John,1,"I love the sounds of Beats headphones. I love the design. I love the deep bass especially in the solo 3. I have now owned 3 different beats in the course of 5 years. None have lasted more than 2 years before one side stops working. Almost all have had their ear coverings tear within a year. I am not an aggressive user. I keep them in their cases. I use it daily at my desk or for talking on the phone. Occasionally for flights and workouts at the gym. This most recent pair started to have the sound go in and out on the left side. This happened with the previous two as well. On my second pair the left side stopped working when on bluetooth but would work when plugged in. then it stopped when plugged in as well. This happened with the first one as well.

I kept buying a new pair thinking it was just me and that I should be even more gentle with them. Each subsequent pair would only be used sparingly (I'd alternate with my airpods but i like the full sound of beats for music). After the second one failed I said I'd give it one more chance. Now after 5 years and 3 pairs that give out after less than 2 years I will never buy another pair and cannot recommend them to anyone who wants a reliable pair of headphones!","December 27, 2021"

Alondra,1,"I bought this product on February 2021, and the right side stopped working today. It seems that the life span of this product is about 1-2 years (same thing happened with my first pair bought from the Apple Store). I only used them at home for a couple of hours while I worked, never took them outside and were always on my desk when not using them. I love these headphones but I don't think they are worth it the price.","July 21, 2023"
Tabitha,1,"I waswildly unimpressed and returned these. The sound sucked and the noise cancelation wasn't good at all. I bought generic $40 ones that are a little bulkier, but the audio is 100x better.","October 20, 2023"
Amazon Customer,1,"I was so excited for these headphones and disappointed doesn't begin to explain it. I received the 1st pair and it only worked on one side. I returned them and purchased another pair and had the same issue once again. At that point, I just wanted to return them and purchase a different brand.","September 26, 2023"

D Pope,1,"3/11/2023 UPDATE… Not even a year has gone by barely 6 months and these headphones are already not playing correctly. Sometimes they play sometimes they don’t sometimes they’re loud sometimes they’re not you just never know in the middle of a song the volume goes up or down or just stops completely when I tried to return them they said that it had been passed the 90 days so now I’m just out $130 Will never ever buy this product again.
*****I bought these for my 21-year-old daughter to wear when she goes to work out at the gym she says the noise of the gym and the clinking of the weights is irritating her… But these earphones are her favorite and she really loves them and says they are perfect for working out! They are “great at counseling noise and stay on her ears without being too tight”!","November 20, 2022"
Kayla K,1,"Bought it in Rose Gold to match my new iPad Air. I did a beautiful unboxing video of them and everything! They LOOK so quality and beautiful together which is why I’m so sad I’ll have to return it as wearing it is EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I really have to finish the music and video editing I was working on but having to use these are like torture! Especially since I currently don’t have another wireless earbud I can use with my iPad at the moment. It also feels very suction-y for the ears and feels like you came off a plane when you take them off. The entire listening experience beyond the very first half hour is horrible. It gave me a headache and after a few days of using them my ears still hurt as I type this. So disappointed. I expected more from apple and from this price. The audio is also not that great. Very basic sounding audio. Oh also, they no longer come with a headphone jack cord like they did upon first release, you can only use them wirelessly now. The battery life is really good. The lowest the battery got was 90% so far and I only charged the battery once for 5 mins. The carrying case feels like it will damage the headphones cause it’s too snug. Overall not worth the money and especially not worth the discomfort!","November 22, 2020"
PN,1,"I don't know if it's because these headphones can fold or whatnot, but after using it for 2 months, the right side fails to connect. I can hear the music perfectly on the left side, but then the right side would static and you can't hear the music from the right side, so only the left side works. It seems like the wires on the right side couldn't really connect. Both side worked for the first 2 couple of weeks, but now it doesn't anymore. Another thing to notice is that these headphones will not cover your whole ear, if that's something that you're looking for. I wear earrings and these sit right where my earrings are so I have to take off my earrings prior to using this headphone. But that's not even my issue. The fact that this doesn't even surpass 2 months was a big disappointment. I have other headphones that are cheaper and lasted longer.","July 26, 2022"
David Ngandu,1," This beat stopped working after 4 months for no reason. I feel like I got cheated on honestly. Paying $126 just for it to last 4 months? Nah, I need my money back","November 25, 2023"
kyara duke,1,"I'm upset with these headphones 🎧 I thought the Beats was a good company but after reading all these reviews and having the same bad experience with the product. Only have had these since Jan 6th of this year! And already the right side has stopped working. I didn't know this was such a major issue or else I wouldn't have wasted my money. It's messed up to think this product is a higher price than most others because of its name, and it has to be the cheapest peace of junk I've ever bought.","May 18, 2023"
Lorie,1,"The blue tooth connection is lost every time I pause my movie. Even during play, it has issues with losing the sound.
For a headset this expensive, I expected much better.

Now, after the return period has passed, it won't work on blue tooth and when I connect it with the cable, only one speaker works. Total waste of money.","August 17, 2023"
aj,1,"The whole reason I got this was to have surround headphones with a mic that I can hook up to my controller. I didn’t sweat the missing 3.5mm realtalk cable, until I realized that it wasn’t just an aux cable it had the microphone.🤬 Not to mention you’re paying an arm for a headset that’s not very comfortable and can’t even utilize the internal microphone without Bluetooth. The A1 apple chip or whatever it’s called is literally just a quick Bluetooth connection that literally only benefits you when you first buy them. The only good thing I have to say about them is when they play Dolby atmos the sound is immersive clear and detailed.","April 3, 2023"
David,1,I ordered these thinking I was getting a great deal. Was excited the whole day to finally use them but as it turns out it was to good to be true. I charged these for approximately 4 hours and the battery was still at 1.tried connecting Bluetooth and nothing. I went from being looking forwards to them to being bummed out real quick. It’s a risk if you’re willing to take it.,"July 13, 2023"
Steven Boynton,1,"I’m on my 5th replacement of the Solo 3 headset which is not working. I can not get my money back, so I keep taking them to the Apple Store where they can not fix them, so they send me a new one which works for up to two weeks then will not connect to my iPhone. WORSE purchase from Amazon ever!","July 30, 2023"

Kevin,1,"I was actually excited to receive these headphones after using my wife's Solo3 Beats headphones. Her's was super loud and had really good bass. Upon receiving them from Amazon, I fully charged the headphones and tried them on. To my surprise, it lacked A LOT of volume and had almost NO bass. I was super confused. I tried my wife's headphones again and it was completely different. She got hers from the Apple Store.

I honestly feel like this was a knock off. Really good packaging, but the actual item is a rip off. Never buying brand electronics from Amazon. Better off going to an actual store. Definitely returning them for false advertisement. It's shocking how different these headphones were from each other.","May 31, 2020"
Momma of 3,1,"Randomly quits pairing with IPhone. I sent it to Apple for repair and they could not duplicate the error so now they are useless and not able to be used.
These are also now considered vintage or obsolete per Apple so no coverage unless physical damage.

Worthless. Buy Sony or Bose with unmatched customer service.","August 31, 2023"

Rossi Stewart,1,"These were great headphones for about the first 9 months. Now, the light will come on when they’re on the charger, but the headphones won’t turn on at all out of nowhere.

Sarah,1,"I’m the type of person that talks on the phone every day. My best friend complains that when I use these, it sounds like I’m talking from the inside of a dishwasher. Not only that, but there is echoing so whoever is on the other line can hear themselves, and barely hear me. It’s horrible. The design is also horrible, it made my ears hurt like a mf. It could be 5 minutes or 5 hours, but the pain just gets worse. I also have piercings. The volume control isn’t the best; I had to turn up the volume all the way to hear the sound and have better sound quality. Also, everyone around me could always hear what I was listening to, no matter how loud it was. You don’t want everyone at the grocery store knowing you’re listening to Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado. There’s noise cancellation, but at what cost? Not the cost of my ears.","June 23, 2022"

Alexis,1,"I received my BEATS solo headphones in good condition, packaging wasn’t opened but when I charged them and used them for the first time, the right side was noticeably quieter than the left.

Johnny Gonzales,1,So I’ve tried the Studio 3 before and I know those are the higher grade ones so I saw these on sale and wanted to give them a shot but there even worse. Idk how Beats can get away charging so much for these Headphones I’m not going to lie at first I turned them on then I found myself clicking the volume button just hoping and praying for the volume to go Higher but no luck at all. I honestly don’t know how people rates these headphones so High I mean they must have never had a good set of headphones for them to be giving these 3-5 stars I mean that maybe deserves a 2.5 based on look and functionality but for what I bought them to listen to music and hear some beats but no these are an absolute fail and don’t deserve more then a 2 when it comes to the sound quality. I cannot believe Dr Dre has his names attached to these or even would.,"January 25, 2022"
Deborah,1,"This is the second pair of beats I purchased for my daughter and they both started unraveling. I thought the first pair did it because I purchased them used but I was wrong. She's only had them for 6 months and this began around month 4 but she didn't tell me. Since I am passed the return date, let's try the manufacturer. Very disappointing.","June 17, 2023"
Mats,1,The Beats Solo3 began having problems shortly after the one year warranty expired. 1) The right speaker stopped working when using wireless Bluetooth. 2) Then it would not turn on to pair/reset. There are many other people with similar complaints. It would cost $120 to repair them. It worked well for a year and a half and now it’s a piece of junk.,"June 20, 2023"
Gillian,1,I opened the package and the jack cable was missing,"November 13, 2023"
Joe Costa,1,"Update: the headphones they sent me as a replacement did the exact same thing. Actually, they only lasted about a week before they started dying within 10 minutes. Apples response? ""hey we will send you a box, for then you to send it back to us, for us to then send you a new one""

Me: ""but I have a box that you've already sent me so you can just send me the label and cut out a whole step""

Apple: ""No we cant do that""

This company is an absolute joke.

This product was absolutely a dream for the first 4 months I owned it. Now the battery dies unexpectedly between 65-85% (its been increasing by 10% roughly every week since it started) and the only option currently is to send them in for up to 2 weeks for Beats to repair them.

Between this, and the insane nose dive that apples customer service has taken, you're better off spending half the amount and buying something from a company that values their customer base more. $2T will make you awful cocky I guess, but I will no longer be dropping upwards of $4000 every few years for updated products. They've lost every ounce of my future business.","November 16, 2020"
