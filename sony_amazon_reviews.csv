Sarah,5,"Guys I’ve struggled with needing good headphones for a while. I always told myself that the cheap headphones are good enough that and I don’t need to buy expensive headphones. But guys, that was such a bad mindset. The cheap headphones would break easily. They’d irritate my ears. The quality of the music was bad and I could hear my surrounding. When I first put on my Sony headphones, I really felt the difference, it’s like night and day guys. These headphones look cute, they dont irritate me at all, they fit nicely on my ears (with little hoops on too!!), the noise cancelling feature is good and can be adjusted with the app, and also if you download the app you can customize how you can hear your music. Genuinely a great purchase and I hope they last for years. My friend influenced me to get them and she’s had hers for two years. One thing I must say is that they’re not tight on my head. So like they may slip a little if I move my head too much but it’s honestly not an issue. I might just keep that in mind if u have a particularly small head. Also, I got these during Black Friday for $248 but the price drops to $228 on cyber Monday so keep that in mind if your buying it around this time. I contacted Amazon to get the price difference and they were very helpful!! Overall, I’m so glad I got these headphones. I have such a load house and it’s a struggle to study for my exams or do my assignments. Now I can do them and not be distracted by my family. Also my younger sister borrows then from me for the same reason. She loves them and might get them next year once she goes to college. If you’re looking to invest in your first pair of pricy headphones these headphones will be right for you!","November 27, 2023"

b,5,"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through Amazon

I originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.

**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.

**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.

**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.

**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.

**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.

**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).

**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.

OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.","June 20, 2023"
Amazon Customer,5,"These are by far the best noise-canceling headphones I have ever owned and are definitely worth the price. So far I have convinced 4 other people to buy them and it has changed our world.

I wear these headphones for 9-10 hours daily, for my WFH job as well as out and about. They are extremely comfortable to the point that I don't even notice the weight. They also have a great built-in microphone that allows me to attend meetings and be heard, even if I've walked away from my computer.

The battery life is also a huge plus, making it easy to get through the day without having to recharge and in the off chance I forgot to charge them, and they die, they're usually charged enough to use the rest of the day within 15 minutes!

They also have top-of-the-line Noise-cancelation, making it easy to focus on whatever I'm listening to/pay attention to work without distraction.

Pros:
-extremely comfortable
-Superb noise cancellation-
-Great battery life

Cons:
-Expensive (But worth every penny)

Overall, if you're looking for noise-cancelling headphones look no further than these. They outperform the competition and even outperform Sony's WH-1000XM 5's that recently hit the market.","December 1, 2023"
Terry Rocks,5,"In my prior life (before kids / wife) I played drums, piano, organ, keyboard and sold instruments for a living. Also had my own armature studio I made mix tapes in. My wife calls me a snob (Audiophile I guess) when it comes to sound. I always loved Sony's studio phones form the 1980-90's. Today, I use Air Pod Pro's and received a pair of Bose 700 as a gift a few weeks ago. I thought they would be great but was shocked at how bad they sounded. As the saying goes ""no highs no lows must be Bose"". I really tried to like them and thought they just really stink for that kind of $$. Before returning back to air pods only, I figured lets try the Sony equivalent (high end) headphones. WOW! These are soo much better than Bose in both sound and features. The app has a many high end features you would think Bose could give you. If you are not in to sound, you are not going to be buying a $100+ pair of headphones. If you are, buy these and you will be VERY impressed!","November 19, 2023"
Alden,5,"I live next to a busy street, and with my old pair of 100ABN's, I would still hear a good bit of traffic noise passing through (Loud pickups, Harley's, etc). I thought that it was an impossible to task to completely get rid of the noise since it was such a low frequency, but putting these on, I have heard absolutely nothing. If anyone is in a similar situation, get these. You won't be disappointed.

The only major cons I have:
- Bluetooth connection does not work well with my TV, specifically when trying to play PS5, so I've had to just wire in directly to the controller, which isn't ideal. I'm not sure if the audio output is encoded differently for that specific use-case or if there is bluetooth interference with my controller, but I was consistently getting stuttering audio when playing. Normal TV usage works fine, just not PS5.
- The dual-connection option is nice, but it has a lot of lag when connecting to a TV. For my case, almost a half-second delay, which was very noticeable. Switching the settings to only allow one connection gets rid of this, but it's a bummer it doesn't just work outright with no catches.
- I've noticed a few scenarios where the ambient noise calibration would change unintentionally (even with auto-calibration off) and I would have to reset it in the app. But, very nice once it's cutting out the right frequencies.

All in all, a significant upgrade from my old 100ABN's. Would 100% recommend. I look forward to using this around the house, and on flights in the future.","October 31, 2023"
Marc Turner,5,"These headphones are a must have. The noise cancelling is excellent, I felt totally isolated from the rest of the world. I love how you can control the settings on the app. I also love that if you're listening to music and want the music to stop so you can talk to someone you just place your hand over one of the headphone speakers from the outside. You don't have to take the headphones off. You can change the volume and skip songs by swiping up and down or right and left.

It's fully rechargeable and you can go wireless or use a cable to plug it in to whatever device you want. The protective case is soft to the touch but is water resistant and padded.

I highly recommend these headphones. The sound quality is clear and well defined. Although if you want a warmer sound you might want to look into other headphones.","November 24, 2023"
Bradley,5,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).
My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).
In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.
Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.
Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.","October 15, 2021"
Alex,5,"These bad boys often go on sale now that the MX5s are out and I believe they’re a great deal compared to competitors for the money. Super long battery life, I recently took a 2 week trip to Europe and only need to charge once (15hr travel time both ways from the US).

Pros:
1. Great noise cancellation
2. Pretty nice sounding (not going to replace anything hifi but for 99% of the time they’re great)
3. Long lasting battery
4. Quick charging battery

Cons:
1. Touch controls on the side of the headphones can be a bit bulky to use (eg. turning up volume and switching songs, a button would be more tactile and probably quicker)
2. The mic is not as good as the newer MX5 but still good enough for most uses. And much better than other comparably priced headphones.","November 26, 2023"
Blake Donovan,5,"The wireless headphones I recently acquired have been a game-changer in how I experience audio, offering both convenience and an immersive sonic journey. These headphones have seamlessly integrated into my daily life, providing an audio escape that's free from the tangles of cords.

The first thing that caught my attention was their sleek and modern design. The headphones are lightweight and well-crafted, offering a comfortable fit that allows for extended listening sessions without discomfort. The on-ear or over-ear cushioning provides a snug feel while effectively isolating external noise, enhancing the overall audio experience.

The wireless connectivity has been a revelation. Pairing these headphones with my devices is quick and hassle-free, and the absence of cords adds a new level of freedom to my movements. Whether I'm working, exercising, or simply relaxing, I can move around without being tethered to a device. The Bluetooth range has been reliable, allowing me to roam freely while still enjoying uninterrupted playback.

The sound quality is where these headphones truly shine. The audio is crisp and clear, with well-defined highs and satisfying lows. Bass reproduction is impressive, adding depth to music genres that rely heavily on low frequencies. The headphones strike a good balance between audio fidelity and consumer-friendly tuning, appealing to a wide range of listeners.

The built-in controls on the headphones are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls with minimal effort. The battery life is generally sufficient for a day's worth of usage, but it's advisable to charge them overnight for uninterrupted enjoyment.

One aspect to consider is that while the headphones do offer noise isolation, they might not provide the same level of noise cancellation as some higher-end models. If you're seeking complete isolation from external noise, you might want to explore noise-canceling options.

In conclusion, wireless headphones have elevated my audio experience to new heights. Their sleek design, wireless convenience, and impressive sound quality make them an essential accessory for music enthusiasts, travelers, and anyone on the go. While they might not offer the top-tier noise cancellation of premium models, their overall performance and value for money are undeniable.

Pros:

Sleek and comfortable design
Hassle-free wireless connectivity
Impressive sound quality with well-defined highs and bass
Intuitive built-in controls for easy use
Cons:

Noise isolation might not be on par with newer models (I can still hear some noise in the gym)","August 19, 2023"
J. Keplinger,5,These were very easy to setup with their app for android. I was able to connect to my phone easily. With all the preset EQ options and some available custom ones you can get these to sound how you want. I'm not audiophile so keep that in mind. These are the best sounding headphones I've ever had. I wear glasses that have plastic ear pieces which means they're thicker and I didn't feel like there was any issues for comfort at all. I was able to remove my glasses and put them back on without removing the headphones. They hold onto my head well without being too overly tight. I shook my head a fair bit like I was running and they didn't move at all.,"November 28, 2023"
tc,5,I've only turned them on and gave a quick listen but they have an incredible sound out of the box and fully charged!! It has options i didnt realize & cant wait to play with it. The reason I upgraded from the off brand cheap set I have is for higher volume and these will blast your ears off and fot like a glove. Ypu can't hear anything with them on....... Not sure how the sound canceling works yet but they are pretty well sealed around my ears. BTW Amazon got these to me same day delivery in 3hrs...... Sorry Santa but I couldn't wait till Dec 25th!,"December 2, 2023"
Sugar Bear,5,"I got these to use with my new LG smart TV - which is probably too smart for me. I had a challenge getting them to pair up with the TV - until I did it exactly as I was supposed to. There is an excellent user's guide online for the headset. The trick was in not turning them on until I was supposed to. The Noise Cancellation works wonderful also, there are three levels - so read the instructions. The headphones are comfortable, absolutely no complaints and I wear headphones 8 to 12 hours a day in a noisy environment. In the past I went with Sennheiser, but I needed something new, that was simple Bluetooth connect and noise canceling..","November 22, 2023"
Romans10-9,5,These headphones are incredible. I was on the fence about spending $350 for these but when Amazon had a coupon for me to get $100 off the price tag of these i seized the opportunity to buy these for $250 and I'm so glad i did. The ear cups on these are so soft for extended periods of listening and the noise isolation is incredible. When you take these off your ears to talk they automatically pause then proceed to resume when you put them back on your ears automatically and come with a beautiful color matching zipper case to carry them. I listen to music with these on Android even though they are specifically marketed toward Apple users but I'm 100% satisfied with the performance and clarity of these headphones. You get what you pay for in life and if listening to music is something you spend a lot of time doing or talking on the phone and use headphones to do just that please consider these headphones because I'm thoroughly impressed with these headphones and i think you will be too.,"October 28, 2023"
Kindle Customer,5,"I work with running diesel engines on a daily basis, anyone with a tractor can tell you how loud those things can get. Brought my headphones with me to work to see if I could use them in place of my Peltor workman earmuffs, turns out XM4’s have better noise canceling.

There are a few annoying features. The app is very Sony, so half the features don’t work and the other half only work some of the time. The touchscreen on the outside of the right muff was cool when I first got them, now it’s just annoying, often increasing/decreasing volume when I want to skip a song. Speak-to-chat is also just a ridiculous feature, can’t use it in public, constantly activates when I’m laying in bed, turns itself back on randomly. It’s classic Sony, awesome tech, miserable software.","November 9, 2023"
Topseykretz,5,"Everything about this product is great!
I was debating whether to get the coveted Airpods Max or the Sony Xm4.
I'm glad I chose the latter!
I love the noise canceling feature.
The carrying case is absolutely practical unlike the Airpods Max carrying case!
I don't recommend putting the volume all the way up as it is too loud for your ears to handle, I would put it in the middle range.
The style is slick 👌 😎 It fits well on any size head since it can be adjusted as needed.
The price is worth it considering all the tech that was meticulously put into these headphones.
I was especially impressed with the battery durability. I only charge it but once a week and use it vigorously every day. It's great for working out at the gym or using it at home.","November 9, 2023"
Daniel Meadows,5,"I have purchased and used a variety of wireless, over-ear style headphones over the years, but the Sony WH-1000XM4 (XM4's from here on), have provided a great experience so far! For simplicity's sake, I will only directly mention the other Sony pair I currently own, the XB900N.

Note:
This review is after one full (out of the box) charge. They lasted almost exactly three days after fairly heavy use. Material used during this period varied from heavy rock to classical, audiobooks, and videos from YouTube. Sections in the review are in CAPS for organization, not emphasis.

The Positive:
+ SOUND is phenomenal on these. Out of the box, they were almost on par with other sets I had set equalizer preferences for. Once the equalizer profiles were created for the XM4's, the music started sounding better than it ever has before through Bluetooth. These clearly favor a warm sound, and shine best when paired with bass heavy tracks, but all of my library has gotten some noticeable benefit from the XM4's.

Sound is different for everyone, but these seem better out of the box than most I've tried, and custom profiles are easy to create with the Sony app.

+ CONNECTIVITY was extremely easy. I had already installed the Sony companion app for headphones from the XB pair I had used before. I have not had any dropped connections so far.

+ BUILD QUALITY feels like a pretty big step up from the XB900N's. Sturdy cans and a very soft headband are a nice combination. I've only had the XM4's for three days but I feel they will hold up fairly well. Considering I've had the XB pair for over a year with no noticeable degradation, I have high expectations here. The XM4's come with a great travel case too.

The Neutral (still positive to me):
1. CHARGING CORD is short. I like it because it is now the easiest charging cord to identify out of all the ones I currently use. The cord it is packaged with limits flexibility for charging locations, but is also perfectly functional for my needs.

2. ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) function is good, almost too good. I have used these headphones a lot since I received them three days ago, and the first thing I noticed when I put them on- the ANC was overwhelming. I became somewhat queasy as soon as I turned them on. Once I opened the app I noticed there was a calibration tool for ANC. Once I went through that process, I no longer felt discomfort when using this feature. YMMV, but these block out most noise in my home, to the point it's just music or the book I'm listening to. I'm still getting used to how strong the ANC actually is.

3. BATTERY LIFE was pretty good, but may have been somewhat under 100% out of the box, despite the headphones declaring a full charge when activated. I did not time my usage, but I probably got around 18 to 20 hours on the initial charge. Some settings for music quality and DSEE (sound enhancement for some content) will lower battery life according to Sony's companion app. It advised against using my settings for the best battery life experience. I appreciated but also ignored this advice. I know I won't be getting the full battery life from it, but it sounds so good! I'm leaving this detail under neutral to see if I get the same- or better - performance from a true 100% charge. Edit: lasted about the same, maybe one additional hour. Still good for daily, heavy use.

4. TOUCH CONTROLS are a big debate among users of Bluetooth headphones. I happen to like how responsive these are, but I've also really liked some other headphones out there that had good old fashioned dials and buttons. I don't know which I prefer over the other, but the touch controls for the XM4's are not bad.

The Negatives:
- These get pretty warm. Ultimately, it isn't an issue to me because I wear glasses and they are still comfortable, just warm after longer sessions.

Overall:
The best Bluetooth headphones I've come across! Definitely worth the price on sale. The XM4's do not disappoint and provide truly top-tier ANC functionality. My new favorite headphones for music and audiobooks on the go.

Thank you for reading my review!
Hopefully the XM4's are finished recharging by now.
Have a great day!","October 26, 2021"
C Stribs,5,"Alright, So I have put alot of time into these 1000xm4s over the last three months. These headphones are fantastic! However it took me about 50-100 hours to get used to them. I'll explain.
So I have owned cheap ""noise canceling"" TAO Tonic $40 black friday special wireless headphones and I had good wired $200 Sennheiser 599 open ear headphones.
My previous experiences with headphones were to get the most out of the audio or to cancel out noise I needed to near max out sound volume and reach deafening thresholds. After listening to these headphones I started to realize I needed to change the way I was using these headphones. First of all the app is nice. You can adjust the EQ to custom or use a preset EQ setting. I chose to turn of the speak-to-chat as it would easily pick up my voice if I was singing along or making any loud adublie sound while working out. But getting back on track I found that I could listen to music, podcasts, Netflix ect at a very low level and hear everything perfectly. I was so use to staying at a 80-90 percent volume from my previous headphones that I was at little sad that the 80-90 level on this headset didn't sound as loud as my older headphones. Simply put these bad boys do such a great job noise canceling that you can clearly hear audio at very low levels. You may not feel alot of punchy bass with them (it's there though) you also won't hear any distortion even bumped to max levels. Also, these Sonys will automatically and continuously track your environment and adjust noise canceling and ambient sounds according to if your laying in bed or get up to a walk, or sitting a plane ect. They will also save you hearing as well but sadly not your bank account.
If you plan to work out with them they will be a solid option. Again I haven't heard any distortion while working out or on a treadmill, bike, or rowing machine. Since they are closed ear style they may get warm on your head. I always get a q-tip out and swipe off the sweat condensation that accumulates inside the left ear cup on the plastic ear sensor after workouts (I dont know if this is recommended). I haven't had any issues with them slipping off my head either.
The hand and swipe gestures take a little time to get used to but work well. Every now and then the swipe forward/backward and up/down to skip tracks or volume doesnt work but I feel this is user error on my part. The cover over the right headphone is a cool feature. It will easily flood ambient sound in allowing you to quickly and temporarily converse with someone or you could leave the speak to chat feature on.
Additionally you receive a nice hard carrying case, charger brick, usb-C cable, and aux cord. I've used the aux cord quite a bit with my nintendo switch and it does a great job. Also the 1000xm4s are very forgiving if you forget to plug them in when runinng low on power. In 10mins I can quick charge them to last about10hours. I think the specs say 3 hours till 100% charge but I swear I had my headphones fully charged in about 1 hour. They are dual voltage which has been great for traveling abord. Lastly you can connect up to two Bluetooth devices which at time. Honestly I didn't think I would even need this feature. However I found out it is very convenient for seemlesly swapping devices or getting notifications from my phone/watch while connected to my laptop or when I'm bluetooth connected to my switch.
So they are a great pair of headphones but you will take a hit to bank account. I picked up a open box Amazon return which knocked off over $100 on the price and the headphones came without any issues. If you see these on a decent sale I would scoop up a pair. Also if you want more of a punchy bass type headphones I would also recommend XBN-900N which I tested out shortly and you can tell they are more focused on bass bumping. I believe they are significantly cheaper new but don't have all of the same features.","January 12, 2022"
Pixel,5,"Download Sony Headphone Connect App, open box, turn on headphones (bottom of left headphone on/off switch), using Sony Connect App, connect and paired new headphones.
- My headphones were 100% charged out of box.
- Many features in Sony Connect App, matter of your preference and use. I do think the app is solid and useful for my use of these headphones.
- My headphones firmware updated automatically -be patient, process took several minutes. Initial impression; very comfortable, really good noise canceling and sound quality.
- Voice clarity on both ends is outstanding.
- Easily connected two iPhones, my experience switching between them was seamless.
- Used ear profile in-app feature to analyze my ear shape for 360 Reality Audio setup.
- Able to connect to MacBook Pro (2020 version) directly via Bluetooth with no issues.

UPDATE: >30 hours of iPhone X, 8, and Bluetooth MacBook Pro connection.
- The phone call quality is awesome (you can hear
- No video lag/latency on FT and Zoom calls.
- I have found the connection at times can be a bit cumbersome when having two devices connected and receiving calls, it might be a setting or how I am picking up the call --directly from the phone or double-tapping on the headset.
- Great noise suppression to the wind, outside city/road-noise, etc... No reported issues with other people on calls with me. Always told call quality was very crisp and clear... my experience, much better than Apple Airpod Pro for suppression of noise for callers on the other end.
- I have also now used these headphones for Bluetooth connection to Nvidia Shield connected to my TV for over 16 hrs. Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings. TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds.

Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4
- Seamless connection - prefer SONY
- Comfort - prefer Sony
- Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose. Sony touch control works ok but the Bose increase/decrease volume seems to work better on Sony
- Noise-canceling for me, both performed in a similar way
- Call quality, for me, both performed in a similar way

I Will continue to test and use Bose but the feel of the headset on my head is not as comfortable as Sony.

UPDATE: Running 7.3 Update
- Not sure if related but the initial bluetooth connection and subsequent connections are problematic;
- I have had to reconnect several times via the app and my phone needs to be very close to the headset;
- Once I am connected it has worked but I have had to repeat the process a few times now;
- Additionally, after significant use, the touch controls are a nice feature but not ideal under some circumstances. For example, if you have a hoodie on, jacket with hood, etc... touch control is sensitive and fabric, cord, ect... will effect the touch controls.
- I am running iphone X with latest iOS, should be receiving iphone 12 Pro this eve and will update with any new comments.

UPDATE April 2020: been using these headphones for several months now. Running and walking are great however, the Touch Sensor Control is not ideal for me, especially when using while exercising. I find the controls/sensor unforgiving and one misstep can restart a song and or podcast, other than they continue to work very well.

Used these headphones for a extended 12+ hrs flight and another 9 hour flight.. great noise canceling and sound. Hooked up directly to Qatar Qsuite entertainment system with provided cable, sound quality was excellent.","August 21, 2020"
s,5,"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.

The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video. Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.

Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.

The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful. That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.

As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s. By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.

I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great. I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)","September 14, 2020"
Arrionna,5,Got these after seeing the reviews that they were better than the XM5s. Yes they’re plastic but they do not feel cheap at all. Sounds are always crisp and having an optimizer for the perfect performance is super convenient. The padded ears are comfortable enough to sleep in and I can wear my glasses with them without them getting squished.,"December 8, 2023"
uebergeek,5,"Disclaimer - These are my first noise cancelling headphones, so I have not much basis for comparison.

I needed something to drown out the world's loudest portable A/C while I work, and I wear glasses. These work (with wire frame glasses - not so great with plastic frames, but I doubt anything would be.) They are quite comfortable; I can wear them for hours before they start to hurt. They do have that ""underwater"" feeling to them so I don't like to wear them constantly - but I imagine that's inevitable with noise-cancelling and even somewhat from just the noise isolation.

The noise cancellation isn't perfect, but did I mention it's the world's loudest portable A/C? They certainly make it a lot quieter. With just fans running, the headphones drown them out entirely.

Sound quality - definitely the best sounding pair of headphones I've ever had for music, but I don't think I've ever had a set that cost this much either, so I may not be the best judge.

I hate to be a consumerist fan-girl, so I'm embarrassed how much I like these. But I gotta say, stuff really does sound good with them. And unlike the ""active noise reduction"" headphones I had before these, they make it possible for my bespectacled head to work in the same room as the world's loudest portable A/C.","October 6, 2023"
Mike,5,"I have used active noise canceling technology in protective ear muffs, and I have had some ear buds that were passive noise canceling, so I kind of thought I had an idea what these where going to be like. Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.

My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.

Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.

I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.

These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.

I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.

I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.","March 15, 2021"
Dixie,5,"I have tried many different pairs of headphones. I've tried the bose qc-45, the bose 700, and many others within this price range, However none of them fit that well and hurt my ears. These headphones changed that, they fit comfortably, and sound is great with a few tweeks in the equalizer. My main issue with a lot of these headphones are touch controls. A lot of people love them but I don't. I tend to wear these as I'm laying down and the slightest touch against my pillow will pause or change the volume of what I am watching. These headphones had the same problem however the difference being there was an option in the sony app to turn off touch controls which sealed the deal for me. The sony xm4's are my favorite pair of headphones right behind the air pods max and anybody who might be on the fence of purchasing these headphones I highly recommend at least giving them a try. I doubt you'll be sending them back. Great job sony.","October 17, 2023"
Alexandra Tavares,5,"Great noise cancelling and sound. Also super comfortable. The case makes it easily portable and fits the charging/headphone jack/etc. that comes with it. The battery life is really good; I can go a couple days without charging it(i use for about 1-3 ish hrs a day for reference). And it charges pretty quick👍🏼 If you’re a student I would highlyy recommend!! These are essential when I’m studying in public areas or at home where it can get pretty loud and distracting lol
My only issue is the sound leakage; at around 50% volume is when you can hear it start to leak out(it’s not rlly obvious what’s playing though), but tbh they’re already kinda loud at a low volume (which is where I usually listen at with these) so it’s not a big thing.","October 23, 2023"
Kathryn Soriano,5,"This is my third pair of Sony headphones (I use different headphones for different things like work versus walking around the neighborhood), and I absolutely LOVE these. I wear them pretty much every day, and the quality is wonderful. Highly recommend (especially if you can get them on sale).","December 7, 2023"
Pauline H.,5,"I wanted headphones that would enable me to listen to videos and music while I was in the same room as my husband while he watched tv. These headphones definitely are the most comfortable, and I love the noise canceling quality. Fantastic sound quality, comfort and style make these worth every penny. I wear them while I clean the house, do art and whenever I want to delve into my own world. Would definitely recommend!","November 14, 2023"
Lauren,5,"Everything about these headphones is amazing, but I wish there was more put into the bass quality with these! They fit perfectly over my ears, which are heavily pierced, and offer amazing noise cancellation! I much prefer these over airpods or earbud-based audio devices!","November 30, 2023"
Mari Orel,5,"I was planning on buying the Airpod Max but they were too expensive for me. These were a great second option, probably even better. They’re comfortable, the battery lasts a long time, the noise canceling is great. No complaints whatsoever. Happy with my purchase!","December 7, 2023"
Amazon Customer,5,"Great headphones, I have had these for 2 years and have noticed no difference in battery life or sound quality. Much better than any beats or skullcandy products I have owned in the past. Very lightweight and comfortable for long listening sessions too.","December 2, 2023"
Mary L Barnett,5,"I had no idea what a difference these would make on flights. Putting them on and having the flight noise go away lowered my ""background stress"" substantially. I never realized how much that noise bothered me until it was gone. They were comfortable for long flights (6 hours each way plus) and the battery lasted really well. I'm never flying without these again.","November 27, 2023"
steffany h.,5,These headphones are top tier! Very comfortable and the noise cancelling is amazing. You can turn off the noise cancelling for a brief moment when someone speaks to you and you can also blast it and no one would be able to hear!,"December 4, 2023"
jeff r.,5,"These are amazing. Sound is high quality, great battery life, and noise cancellation is quite good. I have also used Bose which work well. Don’t filter out everything, but almost everything. Very comfortable, and come with case for travel. Recommend these highly.","December 10, 2023"

FaTHoM,5,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.

Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.

I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.

Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.

Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.

For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.

Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??

Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.

Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.","November 13, 2022"
Sofia,5,"I bought these after a friend let me try his Sony headphones. These are the best headphones ever!! You connect them to your device(s) using an app (everything is explained in their instructions). The app is super cool and has loads of features, including pressure configuration based on your ear shape. The battery life is long and the headphones are super comfortable. Plus the color is super nice. They also come in a nice case that protects the headphones. Definitely recommend, especially for people looking for noise cancellation to study, block out annoying noises, etc.","November 9, 2023"

Chloe,5,"I love these headphones. All the features are really well designed and actually work the way they're advertised, from the noise cancelling to the touch gestures to conversational mode. They feel luxurious to the touch and have no signs of wear or defect after more than a year of constant usage.

Eleanor C.,5,"Love the noise canceling, love the sound quality.

MY ONLY ISSUE is that when I'm on the phone with these headphones, it seems to pick up all the ambient sound around me really well and it's hard for the other person on the line to understand what I'm saying.","November 15, 2023"
TS,5,"Some of the best value for money with these headphones. Apart from everything mentioned in other reviews, I wanted to point out that I've owned these for over a year now, used them almost every day, have used them often to work out, and still have had no peeling or damage on the earpads. Beats brands (have had multiple), Philips, ATH, all of these have had to have earpads replacements after 6 months to a year. I'm not sure how Sony made these pads but they should have started peeling or have had some wear by now.","November 4, 2023"
Viktor,5,"I simply do not have words to describe how I feel from these headphones, in my opinion they are simply the pinnacle of technology and I have only been wearing them for a couple of hours since I received them. The noise reduction technology and sound quality are amazing.","November 29, 2023"
A VERY private person,5,"This item has everything you'd want to have in a noise cancelling device: great sound, good level of noise reduction. BTW, it does NOT cancel the background noise - it reduces it to very low levels. You might not notice it, though, if you're the kind of person who listens full blast to your rap or metallica music.

The headphones work great in an airplane. They successfully knocked off the engines noise, and even attendants' voices on a 5-hour flight to N. Carolina. The headphones come with airplane adapters, so you can hook them up to the airplane's entertainment center. The fit is also good - I didn't feel any pressure points over my ears or on my head, where the headband rests.

Where the noise reduction doesn't work well is in windy conditions. If you ride a bicycle, run, or walk in some wind, you will hear the wind no matter how you set up the noise reduction. This is because of the position of the microphones that sample the outside noise - they are at the top of each ear cup (the oval openings), and thus, in the path of the wind.

The user can answer a phone call, and have a nice chat over the phone while wearing the headphones. However, (s)he cannot start a call like you can with other dedicated headphones. I don't believe it's a big issue because I check the phone anyway, to see whom I'm calling.

The app that comes with it is a great way to customize the headphones. Unfortunately, in order to have some features function, Sony requests some of your bio-metric data by asking you to take pictures of your ears, and send the pictures to Sony for analysis. (You do know, don't you, that the ear shapes are as unique as your fingerprints and eye retina?) In this time and age, when every company is trying to track you even in bedroom, and ""Big Brother"" spies on its citizen everywhere, I won't touch those features with a 10-foot pole if the access to these features is conditioned by giving up my privacy. Your mileage may vary.

One of the awesome features of these headphones is their capability to fold. Thus, they fit neatly in their dedicated case, and don't take much space; which makes it easy to travel with them. Although Sony released a newer version addressing the sound issue with the wind, I opted to still purchase these because the newer version does not fold.

How much do I like them? Much enough to purchase two sets: one for me, and one for my better half.","July 4, 2023"
Tinkeringeek,5,"There are plenty of opinions on these XM 4 headphones. Ignore the negative ones! This thing is absolutely legit! This is much better than the XM5, not by technical specifications but by usability. It is intended to be portable, and for traveling, so the XM4 wins hands down.","November 15, 2023"
Anna k,5,"These headphones changed my life. I lost the case but still take them everywhere with me. Currently at a packed house trying to study upstairs and can't hear a thing going on downstairs.

I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.
The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.

Product: 5/5
Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.
As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.
I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.

As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.

I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!

Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.","February 1, 2021"
Arthur W. Scholbe,5,I just received this product yesterday and I am more than satisfied. I got it because I wanted silence in a noisy environment. The literature that comes with the unit isn't much but Sony has simple videos out that explain how to use the Noise Cancelling Optimizer and the Ambient Noise functions. Yahoo!,"November 11, 2023"
Ryan,5,"I recently moved into an apartment in the heart of my city and I love it, but this being the heart *and* the entertainment district, it's...lively. Thumping club music, loud drunk tourists, revving cars, you name it. I'm also down the road from a busy fire station. And across the street there's daily construction on a skyscraper and even though I'm quite high up, well, so is the construction. I can handle city noise, but I also work from home and sometimes I need peace and quiet to focus. As anyone who's worn earplugs knows, you can only wear them so much before your ears physically can't take it anymore. So I went in search of the best noise cancelling headphones I could find and came across these. I didn't even hesitate before throwing down the $350, desperate for relief. I was optimistic but wasn't sure that they would be able to cope with all the loud, abrupt noises of my environment.

These headphones have blown my expectations out of the water. I'm writing this review as they're pouring concrete at the construction site (for those who don't know, it sounds like a cannon going off every 30 seconds) and I can't. Hear. Anything. Construction crews hammering away at metal poles? Barely hear it. Sirens on the street below me? Barely hear it. Loud party music? Can't hear it. And that's without playing any music, just having the headphones on in silence. If I play any music at all the environmental noise is 100% gone.

In my case I find the noise cancelling power of these headphones easily worth the full MSRP. But the rest of the features are fantastic too. The sound quality is solid; I'm not an audiophile though and don't have much to compare it too so I won't comment any more on that. The battery life is phenomenal. I use these for hours every day and have to charge them maybe once a week, and they charge very fast. They're very comfortable to wear and can easily stay on for hours.

The smartphone app that controls these headphones (which you'll need, I'll get to that in a minute) lets you select from a number of profiles, including custom ones, which make these great for listening to different genres. The app also lets you control the aggressiveness of the active noise cancellation; I usually leave it on max (for obvious reasons) but when it's quieter I like to let in more ambient noise.

The headphones also let you pair to two different devices simultaneously which is extremely useful while working. I have these paired to my work computer and phone, so I can listen to music and take calls on my phone, while also being able to hop onto calls at work the very next second. Incredibly convenient. Also convenient is the long range on these headphones; I can leave my computer and phone on one end of my 1000+ sqft apartment and walk to the other and still be connected. Another convenience is that you don't have to pause music when you need to take these off. Just take them off and they pause whatever you're listening to. Put them back on and it starts right back off from where you stopped. That said, this can be annoying when I just need to itch my ear and the pause kicks in, causing my work computer to open up its music app. Worth it though.

A couple of other small negatives are that the built in touch controls on the headphone are awful and unintuitive, so as I mentioned above you absolutely need the smartphone app. And having these on, even if I'm not playing anything, drains my phone's battery much faster than normal (though this may be an issue with all bluetooth devices). These issues are too minor for me to detract a star though.

So, to sum it up, if you're looking for a great pair of headphones, these are it. If you're looking for the best pair of noise cancelling headphones money can buy, these are it.","December 23, 2020"
moo,5,"I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.

Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!

The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.

Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.

Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.

Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.

Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.

Getting back on topic...

The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!

They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.

There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?

Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)

The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.

The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.

Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.

I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.

The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!

USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.

Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.

All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4. Five stars!","October 16, 2020"

I first heard this headphones with my cousin since she bought some at best buy, I went for a used version here on amazon and had previously bought the sony 720, but they were ok, this on the other hand are wayy better for noise cancellation","October 19, 2023"
Eyeconic,5,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation.

I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup.

I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head.

My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids.

I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies.

On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone).

The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE. Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing.

One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter.

So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.","February 21, 2023"
LS,5,"I was looking at these Sony headphones and bose. I decided on the sony headphones and am happy I did.
Good noise canceling and really good sound quality. Very happy with my purchase.","October 30, 2023"
Ginger Allen,5,"I have had these headphones for about 2 months so this is what I have gathered from wearing them everyday. Please note that I am not a expert on this stuff and use them mainly for school and studying.

Likes:
-The noise cancellation. It is amazing and I don’t have to have them loud in my ears to not be able to those around me, which is very important when studying in loud places.
-The customization of sound through the app. I haven’t had that before so that was interesting to figure out which sound style I preferred.
-I also like the microphone in these as I have been clearer when using them for my zoom classes.

Dislikes:
-The fit when wearing glasses is a bit uncomfortable if you wear them for extended periods of time. It makes your frames dig into the backs of your ears. I have tried different things that were recommended online but none have fixed that issue.
-Now this isn’t a dislike for me as I don’t use this feature often enough to make a difference, but for some this might matter. The switching from device to device is a bit inconvenient (at least when using Apple products which is what I have)

I hope this helps! Overall, these are the best headphones I have purchased thus far.","August 14, 2023"
Justin,5,"Great pair have had them over two years now. As long as you take care of them they are the best headphones I’ve ever used, and I’ve used everything from Bose to Skull candy.","November 4, 2023"
Jackson Vondemkamp,5,"Pros:

Almost everything. The app has every setting you will need and is actually useful.

the sound quality is obviously very good and in my opinion is equivalent to the sound quality of the airpod max’s. you can customize the bass in the settings and the bass clear option is great if you like bass.

The very best thing here is the noise cancelling, it’s actually insane how great it is. it’s better than airpod max’s noise cancelling. people sneaking up on me has been a problem haha.

Cons:

There are definitely some, but they aren’t dealbreakers. The passthrough audio option (or transparency mode) is not very good in comparison to apple’s. for that reason i use these headphones for different occasions like in airplanes, doing school work, and gaming, basically anywhere i don’t need to talk/listen or need heavier noise cancelling. otherwise i use my airpod pros.

The adaptive noise control option actually is horrible. it changes when you don’t need it to. luckily you can turn it off. additionally the setting where any sort of talking coming from you pauses the audio is super annoying. haven’t figured out how to change that yet.

The controls on the right headphone are also not the best. the pause doesn’t work on the first try ever. everything else, like skipping and volume control is a lot easier for some reason. Maybe this is something that gets easier overtime but right now i would’ve appreciated physical buttons for at least pausing.

These cons are not dealbreakers whatsoever, but when researching i never saw these brought up so i thought that this might be helpful.","July 31, 2023"
Dolores Jones,5,"These headphones are pretty good. I’ve been a AirPod user for the past 3 years and the headphones are definitely an upgrade. One thing I will say is that the noise cancelling is not that great. I can still hear the opening of doors outside of my door, with my door still closed. So definitely lower your expectations with the noise cancellation because it’s not that extreme as people have been saying online. Other than that they are amazing!","October 5, 2023"
Samantha,5,"I wear hearing aids so I can't wear the normal ear plug headphones, so I bought these. And they are the best thing I have ever bought! It come with a matching plug in cable for when u wanna plug the headphones into something. And an airplay plug for the cable (idk what it does I've never been on a plane)
The quality is a amazing, noise canceling works great (even when wearing my hearing aids).
They're very comfortable to wear and I can see myself wearing them for a long time without my ears hurting.
The only downside to this is that the charging cable is pretty short, thankfully I had a longer one that works to charge them. But keep that in mind if ur planning on getting these headphones. The charger type is usb type c.","September 11, 2023"

I love the gesture controls and the quality of sound that come from these, IMO they are better than thew newer models that have an even more fragile headband and have a lot less bass punch than this model. Perhaps one of the most overlooked pros of this model is the fact that the carrying case is much smaller than the XM5 and the ability to swivel and fold the headband, allows for a much more travel freindly package!","October 15, 2023"

Hariharan Ravichandran,5,"I bought this headphones on sale at around 240$ and it is definitely worth the hype. I was using a soundcore headphones before and the difference in sound quality and noise cancellation is clearly noticeable. Though this won't give you the noise cancellation observed in XM5s I would say this gives you equally good music and a more than decent noise cancellation. I would say for 100$ less this is a better option compared to the XM5s unless you are disturbed by the small noises you may hear.

I found the pressure in your ears for the noise cancellation on the higher side sometimes, especially when it is already cold outside. But in those times you can choose to cancel the noise cancellation or try to optimize the ear pressure with the in built optimizer","September 22, 2023"
alysa,5,"Best headphones i’ve ever had. a little quiet but it does it’s job very well! when i’m at work, barely any noise or other music leaks into my headphones!!! You can mess with the settings (customize however you want your hz and bass boost or pick out the ones that are pre-made for your taste) when i listen to podcasts i would usually put it on speech but i usually just leave it on my custom made function since i sometimes forget to change it. i use them at the gym often and they are really good there too. sometimes the noise canceling adjusts to a point sound from outside leaks through but you can easily adjust that. it was first frustrating when i was doing either back day or abs it would accidentally change the song with my shoulder but they have a function to turn off the touch pad. good headphones you just have to mess with the settings.","September 9, 2023"
SuperFuzzActual,5,"Bought these for international flights as I travel for work frequently. These really seem to help with the jet lag on long flights, and have a pretty impressive battery life. I used mine for an 18 hour flight to Uzbekistan and still had about 30 percent battery left by the time the plane landed. The noise cancelling is pretty good in most environments, however you can still easily distinguish the screaming baby on the flight a few rows back. Overall design quality is a 10/10, Sound is a 8.5/10, Battery Performance is a 10/10, Noise Cancelling is a 7/10.","October 10, 2023"
Julian Sanchez,5,"These headphones work perfectly for everything I need them for, be it gaming, work conferencing, or listening to music. The sound quality and customizability is best when used on a phone in conjunction with the app, but it works just fine everywhere else too. I've never received a complaint while on a call with them.

I personally listen to plenty of EDM and bass heavy music, and I gotta say that these headphones deliver like none other I've owned. The app again is the most useful in this aspect, allowing full EQ customizing and direct control over the bass quality. Here the noise cancelation can also be set or modes can be set for the adaptive noise cancelation.

When the headphones drop the ball a little is when you use a different device which doesn't support the app. At this point they'll default to whatever your last settings were on the app in terms of noise cancelation, EQ, and volume. If you really want to work around this however it's a simple task to pair your phone as the secondary device to the headphones and control them from there while listening to your primary. The auto switch between multiple paired devices depending on audio input is also great, being able to do this fluently was a big factor for me when shopping. Pairing across multiple devices is really easy after the first time paired, most times automatic.

The final positive point I'll address is the touch controls on the right ear cup. I've seen many listing this as a fail point for these headphones, and I was hesitant about it at first too due to my previous headphones employing physical buttons. However, I've had no issue with the touch controls and actually find them quite convenient. They're not as sensitive as I've seen some claim, maybe they fixed this in a software patch. I've worn these under a hoodie without triggering the controls.

I've been using these almost daily for the past 2 months and I've really only come across two troublesome points. The first is that paradoxically despite having multiple microphones which work during wireless use for calls, when you plug the included aux cable into your device for wired use, the headphones only provide audio and on a call use the connected device's microphone. This was very inconvenient for me as I tried to use the headset in a wired format for game chatting and was held back by the lack of a microphone on the remote, an issue I didn't have with my previous headset. When attempting to make a wired call with my phone in my pocket this became an issue as well for obvious reasons, which is when I first noticed this design.

The second issue I've had is one of comfort. Now don't get me wrong these headphones are comfortable and I wear them for multiple hours at a time, but sometimes my left ear enters in discomfort after these extended periods due to the inner design of the left ear cup. As advertised the headphones detect when you take them off and stop playback accordingly, but to accomplish this they use a rather large sensor in the interior of the left ear cup. This sensor ends up pressing against the tip of my ear and becomes annoying after some time, but its not usually an issue and thus not a big enough problem to stop me from wearing them daily for hour long sessions.

All in all I fully recommend these headphones as long as the two issues noted above aren't a deal breaker for you. They've served me well and I've felt like I've gotten value for my money.","March 28, 2021"

These are so comfortable to wear, I've worn them for hours and hours at a time with no issues, and I'm extremely sensitive and things bother my ears easily.

The noise canceling is insane, I love it. It also has a lot of really cool features that make it really nice to use. If it gears you speaking, it automatically lowers the music and turns off noise canceling so you can have a conversation.

It also automatically pauses the music if you take the headphones off your ears for a second and resumes when you put them back on.

They also look very nice, which isn't a huge deal to me, but it's nice because I don't feel silly wearing them around.

Overall, these are one of the best purchases I've ever made","August 6, 2023"
Jessica,5,"I have never spent more than $70 on a pair of headphones, so Sony's new XM4 Headphones was a large purchase for me.

To give you some context, my main headphones have been the Sony MDR7506 Large Diaphragm Headphones.
They've been awesome for delivering balanced sound, creating music and using for my laptop when I'm stationary, but they've never been the best type of headphones to bring with me when I'm on the go or traveling.

I've had these headphones for 3 days now, and while I expect more updates in the future via the Sony Headphones app, I've been pleasantly surprised to find how comfortable they are and convenient to use when I'm walking around or simply relaxing in my room.

Compared to my previous headphones, if I wore them longer than a couple of hours, my ears and sides of my head would hurt. As a glasses wearer, I was concerned that these headphones would do the same, but they've been awesome so far - I've worn them for 6 hours straight with no ear pain! :)

I prefer turning off the Ambient filter setting in the app while I'm at home, since I like to hear what's around me, but once I start traveling again, I'd imagine I'd use it more. The noise-cancelling definitely works, even without the headphones turned on - I almost find it disorienting how quiet everything becomes when I turn the headphones on (I'm used to a lot of background noises in my daily life).

In terms of sound quality, I can't say I was amazed. This mostly is because I think I already had a pretty great pair of headphones to begin with, and now with the XM4's I can hear details a bit more thanks to the noise canceling! I haven't experimented much with the equalizer yet within the app, but that's something I would like to update people on as I continue to use them.

The only disappointment I have so far with them is the incapability I have with pairing them with my main PC.
I checked to make sure my drivers were updated and the headphones themselves, but they seem to have a hard time being detected at all, or they are paired as an ""other device"" on my Windows 10 PC. This could be due to my own doing, as I built the PC myself, and perhaps there is a problem, but nonetheless, I tried to find a solution online but couldn't find one...so I have resorted to using them plugged in, which is a tad disappointing, but I do realize these headphones are more meant for on-the-go then plug and play.

Considering this is my first time buying expensive headphones, I want to be honest - I think I may have been better off buying cheaper ones, but at the same time, they do deliver what they said they would - the speak to chat feature is extremely helpful when I'm busy or my hands are full and can't actively touch my phone or headphones (the music or whatever you're listening to is paused and outside voices are amplified so you can hear what you and others are saying). This feature can be disabled in the app, and set to different times in terms of when to turn off. EX: I was speaking to my mom when I was doing the dishes, and I couldn't quite take them off when my hands were wet - music was paused and I could hear what she was saying! :D

I'll probably update this as I start using them more when I'm outside the house.

I hope this helps you decide if you would like to purchase these headphones.

Daniel,5,"I generally get about 30hr of battery out of these which means I don't have to charge them super often. They have great sound. Noise canceling is very good. Different modes for ambient sound, noise canceling, normal. Function button to use for smart assiatant or other. They are not water proof and if you plan to use them while sweating - buy headphone covers. These are overall very durable and mine are still in like new condition after multiple years of regular use. The battery life is still similar to when I first purchased them.","October 4, 2023"
5001craig,5,"I am really impressed with these headphones. I tried the airpod and airpod pro and they never fit my ears--I ended-up putting ear muffs over the airpods so I wouldn't loose them. They sounded like crap because they would not be in exactly the correct spot (and they didn't fit my ears to begin with). I thought if I'm wearing the ear muffs over the air pods I might as well get some over the ear headphones. And these are something. Putting them on then turning the power on you can hear the noise canceling work--all the noise in my house disappears. It's amazing. I wear these while riding the mower and while I can slightly hear the engine, it sounds faint--kind of like it's far away.

I made a call to my wife and she said I sounded fine.

Pros
Excellent noise cancelling
Very good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)
Battery life
Excellent Bluetooth range
Automatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency mode

Cons
Touch controls are simply awful!
Dual Bluetooth device support
Constant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabled
Voice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make. A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.
Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left ear
Somewhat complex set up process

Overall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones. The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent. This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available. The Bluetooth range is also exceptional. Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone. They have long battery life and charge quickly. They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful. There are many other features with a range of benefit.

Comfort:
They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush. However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.) If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.

They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses. They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.

Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:
These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously. The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time. I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones. I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app. I was then able to play music from the MacBook. I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something. It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky. Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch. Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device. Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.
This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where. This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35. I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.

While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device. It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device. Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2. The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.

I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app. This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices. It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices. You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device. You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected. You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.

Bluetooth range is excellent. It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another. The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent. For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.
The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable. Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response. More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep. You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight. The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies. Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified. Male and female vocals sound good and natural.
The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment. These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment. High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.
The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences. I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.

If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones. They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier. That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.

I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth. The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth. I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones. They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing. The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound. Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good. Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.

I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet. This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS. You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it. You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play. I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better. To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.

I did try the DSEE Extreme feature. This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content. I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music. It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better. At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies. It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable. This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used. The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.

The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal. I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup. I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic. There was some front/rear placement depth. It was interesting to play with for a while. What I found though is that it just sounded strange. I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical. Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable. It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above. Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks. Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical. By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.

Phone calls
The audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations. With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls. They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.
Phone call microphone:
Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with. Most people said I sounded fine. I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone. They said I sounded “far away.” On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.
They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19. This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.

Noise cancellation
These are fantastic at noise cancellation. I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35. At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call. My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these. I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these. I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring! Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music. I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane. Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice. They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.

One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.

Battery:
Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls). These definitely exceed the rated battery life. With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use. I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge. Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable. On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic. It is more than enough though. It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use. Almost any other use it should be more than enough. I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.

Charging:
These charge with a USB-C connector. They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply. They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it). You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging. I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity. They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power. In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick. It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.

User interface:
This is the worst aspect of these headphones. The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable. Simple buttons would have been much better. Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing. You try and turn the volume down and track changes. To be fair, they do have a volume control. The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.
Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right. Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume. Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume. Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that. I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times. Simple buttons would have been SO much better.

Voice assistant:
Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device. It will then want to pair with Bluetooth. I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt. If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.

Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app). You could just say Alexa and it worked. You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would. It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app. The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though. This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content. It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume. Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems. This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better. It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google). I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.

The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying. At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard. This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode. While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode. This mostly works. In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it. Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode. There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet. You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while. Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.

Another feature is adaptive sound control. This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions. This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc. I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.

As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying. It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions. This can be disabled in the app. If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well. (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!)

App

The app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones. Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual. The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more. You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears. I went through the whole process.
There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK. It can be a bit confusing.

The app does provide a lot of control and information. It shows battery level, and the current codec in use. This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details. Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.

Case, accessories
A nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35. It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.

A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system. The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling. It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.

While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.

Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.","October 11, 2020"
Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.

Microphone and Playback
The E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.

Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.

Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile
Both associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.

Brand
Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!

Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.

ANC
When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.

In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.

Connectivity
The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.

Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.

Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).

App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.

Voice Assistant
The E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.

Controls
On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.

After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.

Comfort and Style
Comfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.

Extra
The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.

Issues
There’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.

Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.

UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","February 13, 2021"
Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.

I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.

Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)

UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.

These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.

PROS:

1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.

2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.

3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.

4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.

CONS:

1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.

2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.

3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.

Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.","September 24, 2020"
T. Apuzzo,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.

UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.

UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.

Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.

Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:

Pros:
+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.
+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.
+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.
+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.
+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold
+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound
+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.

Cons:
- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.
- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps
- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears
- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs
- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.
- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature instead

Equal:
* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer
* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones
* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)
* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter
* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4
* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!
* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)
* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4

Personal Preference:
* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors
* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.
* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.

Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.","September 1, 2020"
tojesse,4,"I use these headphones for listening to music and gaming/voice chat.

Other than this SINGLE problem, this headset is excellent:

The default sound values are super muddy in the low range (~400) when using Bluetooth. Use the mobile app to change that range way down, then turn up TrueBass. You will get a sound closer to wired, which, in my opinion, is the best.

You also cannot connect this to a PC wirelessly and use it as a microphone without heavily dropping in audio quality, but this is a limitation of Bluetooth.

The noise cancelling is invaluable to me as I am often in environments with jets overhead or people talking or TV. The sound quality (after adjusting) is stellar. I really can't praise it enough on this factor. Battery life is definitely around 8 hours when listening over BT, and charging times are very fast, about 20 minutes to full. Ear pads are replaceable. I've owned my set for 3 years now. The gesture controls are really nice when your phone is out of reach.

Be careful if you sweat with this on, or live in a very humid environment. Any water can break the noise cancelling microphones, creating a loud screech. This can be fixed if you let them dry.","December 6, 2023"
EliteTek IT,4,"Scroll to the bottom for pros and cons!
The amazing sound produced by these Headphones can only be matched by the perfection of the ACN(Active Noise Canceling). With dynamic control from an app on your device to to the touch controls on the earpiece, ease of use is definitely a bonus feature. Sony spared no expense in attempting to build a lightweight comfortable headset and they succeeded.
I purchased these headphones for a couple different reasons. First and foremost was for a long international flight I was preparing to take, and second was for a gym alternative to my AirPods. Though I have nothing against the AirPods, I was tired of sticking things in my sweaty ears.
The first thing I noticed about these Sony headphones was the Dolby Atmos surround sound clarity. I first tested them in my home with my laptop making sure the Bluetooth connection was solid and clean. I was amazed at the dynamic range of sound and the realistic sound placement while watching high action scenes. I literally felt like I could look around and see the gunmen.
The second thing I noticed was the amazing quality of the ACN which can be adjusted for sound pass through in the app. While walking through the airport, my phone lost signal for a moment and i immediately feared the headphones were the issue. As I removed them from my ears I was shocked at how loud the airport was. People talking, jets whirring up to taxi, the voice over the PA had been completely shut out. I put them back on my ears again and took them off several times marveling at the difference. Now that my childlike wonder was satisfied and it was time to board my plane.
While waiting for taxi I listened to the cabin taking in all sounds and soon found myself dying to drown out the noise again. I set the pass through to about half sensitivity and put them back on. After some adjustment in the app I was able to find a perfect balance of cabin announcements and my music (Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, Morgan Whalen for reference).
Ultimately over the course of the next 24 hours these headphones never left my head. I only needed to place them on to the charger after landing at the destination. Yes I was awake the whole time attempting to counteract jet lag. Conversely on the return trip I used nothing but the ACN to drown out noise and I slept comfortably(as you can on a plane) with them on the whole way home. These headphones completely stopped the drone of the engines and made for an enjoyable listening experience.
The only thing that has disappointed me regarding my Sony Headphones is their functionality during active gym sessions. Though they were not excessively hot, sweat tended to make the earpieces very slick. They would slide around and even off while lying in horizontal positions such as bench press or push ups. In both sessions I wore these I found myself paying way more attention to trying to find a way to stop the slipping that I eventually took them off midway through the second session due to annoyance.
Overall for lightly active people(walkers, hikers, traveling by car plane train) these headphones are a great sound at a great value. My only reason for a 4 star rating is the inability to use them functionally in the gym. (Yes I know there is nothing that claims these are for active wear)

Pros:
-comfort
-lightweight
-great battery life
-ACN works wonderfully
-Amazing Bluetooth range
-convenient folding design makes storage easy

Cons:
- not meant for active individuals that sweat.","July 1, 2023"
Michael23,4,"I was looking for headphones for work and personal usage. I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):
1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)
2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)
3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)
4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)
5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)
6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)
7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)

After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:
Bose 700
Sony WH-1000XM4
Jabra Evolve2 65
Jabra 85H
Jabra Evolve 75

And I ultimately ordered the top 3.

Here's my review:

Sony WH-1000XM4:
- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use
- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time
- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphones
though its microphone quality isn't great
- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for him

Bose 700:
- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)
- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time
- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not great

Jabra Evolve2 65:
- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose
- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did
- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with Bluetooth

SOME TAKEAWAYS:
- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality
- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off
- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the past

DECISION:
I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:
1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.
2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.

Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.

So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!","January 10, 2021"
A. Matthewson,4,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:

- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).
- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.
- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.
- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.
- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).
- Mobility.
- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.

Cons:

- Price.
- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.
- Ears can become warm after a while.
- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.

To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.

All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.

Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.","August 26, 2020"
Chrissy,4,"As someone who gets overstimulated very easily these are an absolute game changer. They block out so much noise even when if I’m only watching a video or tv show, and when I do have music playing I hear little to nothing. The sound quality is great for my standards (which is like, an average person’s standards) and being able to take them with me anywhere in the case it comes with is a plus. Since they fold up they’re very lightweight, but don’t have that cheap plastic-y feel to them. The battery life is what I love about these headphones. I can go about three days without having to charge them, and that’s with noise cancelling on.

However, I do have a couple of issues with them. The multi-device connection is very finicky. The lady in my headphones will often announce “device # connected” even if I’m only playing audio from one of my devices. It got to the point where she was announcing it so many times that I had to turn the multi-device function off. It’s not that big of a deal, but for how pricey these headphones were I’d hope they wouldn’t do that. My other thing is that it takes a while for audio to connect when I turn the headphones on. For example, I’ll turn my headphones on while my phone is playing a song through its speakers and there will be about a 3-5 second delay for the audio to come through the headphones (but maybe I’m just being picky). Another thing I found difficult to use was the play/pause function on the right side headphone. I can use the volume and swipe function just fine, but I haven’t figured out the play/pause function.

TLDR - Great for if you get overstimulated and you’re in the market to buy headphones, kinda finicky but still a good buy (but only buy it when they’re on sale)","September 26, 2023"
Hans Schulze,4,"When my wife's iphone has my headset paired, I can't connect to it from my Samsung. It's like the iphone is holding the two BT channels hostage. If she turns off her BT or unpairs, I can use the headset.

When connecting to my Samsung TV 75"", it sometimes crashes the headset, spewing random noise until I turn them off. I have to unpair them from the TV, and start over.

xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.

Pros:
When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.

Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.

Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.
While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.

Cons:
Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.

Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.

Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.

Noise-Cancelling
To anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.

Connectivity
I've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)

App
Pretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.

Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.","November 12, 2020"
MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.
The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.
The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.
The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.
The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.
The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.
The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.

Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.

If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.","May 20, 2022"
Tayne,4,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.

But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.

I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.

I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:

- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear
- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.
- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)
- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.

CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLY

One of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:

1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.
2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.
3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.
4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.

Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.

OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKS

It seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.

Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.

FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)

Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)","August 23, 2020"
Emily Hatton,4,These headphones are not bad at all after 3 weeks of me owning them I think they are pretty decent BUT a TON of there features do not work even when they are turned on thru the app for example your music is supposed to pause when you take the headphones off. These headphones are not the best and not the worse. I would probably recommend skullcandys for over the ear headphones and airpod pros for inside the ear headphones,"December 8, 2023"
Belle Uy,4,"I bought these simply just because of TikTok and they did not disappoint. I bought noise cancelling headphones from Target for about 70 bucks they were ok, flimsy, and squeezed my head too tight. I haven’t gotten a headache while wearing these. The earmuffs don’t necessarily get too sweaty because I’m not working out with them. But they are wonderful. Noise cancelling is constant but can be adjusted. They slip off my head if I jump around too much but not too bad. Sound is wonderful, and adjustable using their app in case you like more base! I used a $100 gift card and bought while they were discounted so if you can wait until a discount or holiday hits, I would say do that to save some cash!","October 24, 2023"
Amazon Customer,4,"The Sony WH-1000XM4’s is a comfortable pair of headphones, designed for comfort, convenience, and to provide a whole new hearing experience with music and audio. Its base focus is ergonomic meaning it has adjustable bands, a comfortable padding, and smart controls that you can customize to suit your preferences. In March 2021, I was searching for a new pair of headphones for my birthday and this happened to come up. At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.

Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.

Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.

Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.","February 22, 2023"
Miles Sherman,4,"Day 1: Already love these more then my Beats headphones, Quality seems better overall.

Padding is unbelievably soft, the application has many features to change the sound, love how the carrying case has compartments for the accessories.

Like how I do not have to click a button on the headphones to start a song or activate Siri, now is a light tap.

CON:
Was dancing and almost any little touch will turn the song or start it over. Will look to see if I can temporarily turn this feature off for a period of time.","October 30, 2023"
Sarah,4,"I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.
Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.
Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.
I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.","July 24, 2022"
Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.

I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.

The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.

The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.

The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.

The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.

In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.

The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.

The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.

Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.

The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.

The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.

Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.","May 9, 2021"
Kelly Malone,4,"The battery on this thing is no joke, it’ll last you a 24 hours! I have a oval/oblong shaped head, and the headband part can hurt the top of my head after an hour or so. Great sound quality, and the noise canceling is top tier. Great for the price. Not the best headphones, but good for their price.","November 8, 2023"
Kaladin Stormblessed,4,"I've been pro-Bose for YEARS (QC35's being the most recent headphones). Not necessarily for the booming bass/audio quality, but for the convenience factor (on the go, on the plane, zoom meetings, etc...), excellent battery life + amazing noise cancellation. To balance, I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (though oddly designed), sound great both via Bluetooth or cabled/analog via a DragonFly, playing FLAC, etc...

Well..., my QC35's encountered the infamous always-on ""feature."" Flipping the button to off will give you an audible beep that it's being powered off, only to find that you missed 20 calls in your log that you never heard ring. If you're under warranty, you're golden (they'll offer to fix or a discounted upgrade). If not, you're forced to operate with miniature tools under a magnifying glass to bend the button contact points to maintain constant connectivity to the board. My QC35's were months out of warranty & I was SOL... Hacked per all the DIY vids which worked well for about 6 months. Earlier this week, however, I noticed several missed calls + the Bluetooth connection active. Sure enough, the Bose were ""back at it again..."" Didn't feel like hacking for another 6 month band-aid, so seriously considered picking up a pair of 700's. My coworkers, however, (the same ones who all originally had/suggested Bose), said they switched to Sony months ago... After researching pros & cons/side-by-side comparisons, the WH-1000XM4's seemed more & more a worthy competitor/option...

Go-To Amazon of course had the WH-1000XM4's in-stock (& $60 cheaper than the Bose!), so ordered without hesitation. Headphones arrived (packaging & product) looking very slick (nice touch w/ the rose gold accents on black. Charged for about 30 minutes, then tested audio & call quality... BLOWN AWAY... Streaming music, movies, etc... seemed lightyears beyond what I subjected myself to w/ the Bose. My QC35's sounded flat & bass was non-existent. These headphones feel like I'm back in the mid 90's, cruising in my lowered Accord on wire wheels, bumping my Cerwin Vegas powered from an M100 Phoenix Gold Amp w/ Boston Acoustic pro series highs/mids. Yes, ""slight"" exaggeration (anyone w/ 12"" Vega's know what I'm talking about), but it DID take me back... Beyond impressed... No issues w/ audio quality as well on my Zoom's or direct bt to my phone.

So..., audio quality is OUTSTANDING... What caught me off guard, however, was the noise cancellation! I thought Bose was amazing, but Sony's latest technology is on another level. It works so well, it's scary... Damn near can't hear a thing when they're on. Without any audio at all, it's as if you're trapped in ""soundproof vacuum purgatory,"" with nothing but you & your now blaringly loud tinnitus to keep you company. When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, you (to be continued: Apparently, my family has been calling my name for the last 10 minutes. They gave up & sent my youngest upstairs to physically wave her hands in front of me @ my workstation to tell me we're eating soon. Yes, the noise cancellation is THAT good). Ok, continuing where I left off above: When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, your ears are now hyper-sensitive to every day sounds. Birds chirping, humming of video equipment, the heater, etc... I always assumed that Bose was the leader in this technology, but Sony just knocked it out of the park...

As far as cons? Very minimal & more of annoyances if anything... I use mine strictly for voice & audio (though I did install the app), so not really taking advantage of any of the advanced features. The Bose has a massive R & L inside the padding + the on/off switch is an easy queue as to which side is R or L. The Bose padding at the top of your head also appears to be a bit firmer/more comfortable. With the Sony, the buttons are camouflaged into speakers & the R & L are tiny (but color coded) markers on the inner headset. Marking is tiny, but as long as you associated Red with Right, then you're golden. Also, after a prolonged period of time, the very top of my head was throbbing/sore. I'd have to raise the headset slightly to give the to of my skull a break. Again, these are merely minor annoyances & the pros far outweigh the cons...

Can't really say much more & for those TLDR, Sony's WH-1000XM4 put my Bose QC35's to shame (voice, audio & outstanding noise cancellation). Not sure how long these suckers will last, but assuming they stand the test of time, I don't see any reason why I'd ever return to Bose...","December 21, 2020"
Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.

If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.

Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.

Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.

One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.

A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.

Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.

Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.","April 22, 2021"

Sam,4,"Okay so I expected to love them. I only kept them for a week and honestly I did not like them. They feel cheap(flimsy) compared to their price. You also can’t ever be comfortable with them they stick out too much and maybe my head is too small but they would always slide off. Another thing that I hated was that it would turn off when it was on both of my ears and I was watching something but when I took it off and I had set it to turn off, it wouldn’t turn off and it would stay on. Like what! It did the opposite of what I wanted it to do, also the voice control sucks because I don’t want to control anything with it and it would turn on. Sorry I just returned them today i can’t keep something that I spent so much money on and I don’t like it. Maybe it’s simply just not for me. So I’m not saying don’t buy it but I’m saying that if you do and you don’t like them then return them don’t feel bad about it either.","August 15, 2023"
Jae Lee,4,"To give you some context: I've had 3 ANC/noise cancelling headphones now. The Sony X4s are my third. I started with a $40 pair of Taotronics. These are great for a budget pair of noise cancelling headphones. I moved up to a more expensive pair of Taotronics 90 (~$80). The Sony XM4 is my third and at this junction, I was looking for the following features:
1. Better noise cancelling.
2. Better comfort, that I would wear longer than an hour).
3. Better sound quality (for music and podcast).
4. Portability (for traveling).

The Sony XM5 just came out so these XM4 were priced at $228. I'm not used to spending this much on headphones but I'm glad I decided to upgraded to these. I was on the fence about the XM5s but the ability to fold the XM4s up, plus the fact that it was priced much less was all the reason I needed to go with the XM4.

Things to note about the XM4s:
1. ANC - Noise cancelling is great. It covers more of the frequencies than my previous cheap pairs did.
2. Ambient Sound - Ambient noise is pretty bad. When you turn noise cancelling off to talk to someone or to hear the outside world, the sound is hollow. If you want ANC headphones where ambient sound comes through clear, these XM4s are not the best. They have the feature but it's not great. Personally, I just take my headphones off when I need to talk to someone. Otherwise, I only wear these with noise cancelling on.
3. Comfort - The XM4s are very comfortable. I can easily wear these for 2 hours+ without any discomfort. I've slept in these too (to help me sleep). The ear cushions are soft and pliable enough where I don't feel any pain points. As other reviewers have mentioned, because it does such a good job with noise cancelling, there will be heat that builds up inside, especially if you're exerting energy or wearing these on a wam/hot day. It's not unbearable; just something to note.
4. Sound Quality - Sony has an equalizer you can mess with and it helps to fine tune the how music or speech (ie., podcasts) comes through but it's not as good as some of the higher end headphones. But again, for $228, these headphones are a good deal, especially compared to others in the same class.

Note: There are other features like the auto-pause, touch navigation (ie., play/pause/next/prev, and volume), and the hand-over-ear to turn ambient noise on... These work fine for me. I like how it works but I don't consider these as PROs or CONs... They're just different and may be useful based on personal preference.

Summary: I would highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones at the current price of ~$228. If you want comfort, portability, slightly better sound quality than other comparable/competing brands, this is a very good choice. If you're coming from cheaper-type headphones, these are a great upgrade. If you're on the fence between a much more expensive pair of headphones AND need a pair of affordable headphones straight away, these are a great option. I will likely purchase another in my lifetime but these will work for me for years to come until one that has better sound quality for music and speech becomes affordable [for me].","November 28, 2022"
Maria,4,"These are awesome, great noise cancellation, easy setup and nice sound quality. I didn't give the 5 stars just because if you're a new headphone user and your not used to thight stuff in your head you will have to get used to it as me but it is not horrible!","November 10, 2023"
TWIYJaded,4,"Update:
I have come to realize something is going wrong on how the audio is getting processed, dependent on a still unknown reason. Since I am not sure if it is the fault of the headset, or my BT hub, I felt inclined to update the review. What I can offer for anyone that may stumble on this same issue later, is a workaround. When I load a game (PS4 or PC) through HDMI inputs on TV (which is using optical input into the BT hub the headset connects to), sometimes the spatial audio will obviously be out of whack. A fix seems to be to power off the headset, power off the TV (which is what powers the BT hub), turn back on TV and make sure its on HDMI input of device I want (PS4 or PC), then power back on headset. This seems to work every time so far and deliver some form of spatial audio that is accurate.

Prior:
I am writing this to simply inform (or be informed if I am still ignorant to something) about this headset and 3D audio (spatial/surround/etc). I am no audiophile or expert, but I am fairly tech savvy to know how to troubleshoot any issues over 20 years myself, from PC issues to home theatre setups. I'm not a big online gamer, so I wasn't too particular in the past and used TB wireless game sets, always the $300-ish models with wireless 2.4 + BT connections. Being sick of their products short lifespans, I finally went looking for a new brand.

Most gaming headsets are ugly monstrosities to me and I don't care about mic all that much either. A leading SteelSeries model that hit most boxes I wanted checked was out of stock, so I chose these Sony's after enough 'research' (a few hours googling) and finding many did recommend them for gaming, with just some caveats about mic compatibility between systems mentioned. Tried as I might, I couldn't find anything conclusive or abundant to suggest they'd be incapable of providing that 'surround' effect any gamer would expect to have.

Well I am hear to warn others, you will not get that from this headset. Without getting into lossless formats, simulated 3D audio, or any other confusing info, the avg person should just know, it all seems to come down to any normal BT connection just can't do what 2.4 does on its own*, in producing or simulating accurate spatial audio. For weeks, I'd fiddle with everything I could think of and nothing worked. If sounds should be to my 7 o clock, they'd sound like my 9 or 5 or even the complete adjacent side at times. I still hope someone will point me to some aspect I am missing that could resolve this, but otherwise beware, you will not want these for a wireless gaming headset. Wired should be fine to my knowledge though, but I could care less personally to even test that on my end, and will be starting my search over again for a new wireless set.

*Worth a mention for confusion's sake, the WH-1000XM4 advertises HI-Res audio functionality, but it is not at all gaming related. To the best of my understanding and to keep it simple for the avg person without specifics on needing to know what DSEE or LDAC is, just be aware, even if a gaming headset can do 3D audio well just on BT (vs 2.4), its basically because of their own tech involved to produce or support accurate spatial audio. I will add, outside this substantial limitation for the WH-1000XM4 (that may have been my own fault for not learning of beforehand), the product is great otherwise. If use with gaming is not a concern to you, the Sound in Music/Movies, Battery Life, Noise Cancelling, etc., all are as good as I would have expected based on other's reviews.","November 25, 2021"
Mark,4,"Bought these & Bose qc45s to see which of the two I liked better. I got the xm4 first then the qc45 came after. I thought I was sold on the qc45 but found myself not liking the sound after returning the xm4’s. These headphones just sound more pleasant & more balanced than the qc45. I also like the extra features & customization you get with these & can change it to your own liking, which I felt the Bose lacked. Definitely see these headphones lasting in the long run as they won’t be used as harshly as my Beat Studio 3s which I use for the gym.","October 12, 2023"
Jacklynn Concepcion,4,I bought these for my girlfriend. She loves them. I will say this though about the delivery. It was delivered to the wrong house.

William D.,4,"These are very good headphones. The noise cancellation & sound quality are A-. My grade is based on a comparison to a pair of Bose QC15’s that died. The noise cancellation on the Sony’s are better, but the sound quality was not as good. The Sony’s are still a very good pair of noise cancellation headphones.","October 30, 2023"

Mea,4,"I purchased these and returned them after a few days. I liked the sound. When you download the app, you can mess with the sound through the equalizer and I really liked experimenting with that and the bass to adjust the sound to your specific liking. I also liked the carrying case, and that you can plug it into a wired configuration. Unfortunately, I found that the fit was very uncomfortable for me. It felt almost heavy on my head, and despite any adjustments I tried to make, it wouldn't feel comfortable. I have small ears, for reference and an average size head. My brother and sister both have bigger heads and they felt like the fit was absolutely fine, so I don't imagine that my discomfort will be at all the case for most purchasers. My sister actually ended up getting a pair and loves them, so I would still recommend them to most people wanting to purchase good quality headphones.","June 23, 2023"
Nguyen Tran,4,"Right off the bat these headphones look and feel pretty nice. The quality is pretty good overall, even though its body is made of plastic. The case house the headphones with some internal pockets for the included cables, there’s a net pocket on the outside that can probably only hold something relatively thin or flat. No wall adapter included with these headphones. They feel quite sturdy, haven’t truly abused them just yet, but they seem to handle flexes and movement pretty well so far.

The headphone fit is pretty good, they fit is snug but not overbearing. Headphone doesn’t move when I’m moving. Ears do get a bit warm with long use, but that’s expected.

The battery life on this is amazing, I been listening with it for a couple hours and it barely used up the battery. I also notice that it charges pretty quickly and even with a small amount of charging, I was able to get a couple hours of listening easily.

I’m glad they opted to include the headphone cable (and nice touch with the included airplane adapter), I still have devices I prefer to connect over cable, and having this option is very welcomed.

The touch control is probably…my least favorite thing about these headphones. I kind of wish they had physical buttons, I feel like I’m always have to repeat a motion or press to actually have it work. In the end I mostly opt to use my phone or pc to make changes. I do like the custom button that allows you to change the function, I just wish there was more flexibility with choice in that matter.

The sound quality sounds pretty great, it has a strong bass emphasis, but not muddled at all, still can make out the different notes and tones. Listening to music or watching movies are pretty great on my phone.

The microphone quality is okay, people tell me they can hear me, voice comes through loud but clarity is a bit lacking. The noise cancelling while on call is pretty good, people don’t hear or barely notice any of my background noises.

This model allows you to connect to two devices simultaneously, I tried it out with my android phone and windows pc and it works as intended! I was pretty surprised how easy it was to flip between the two. Though I didn’t like that the codec was limited to AAC with this mode, but I guess that’s a limitation of having the two devices connected at the same time. I actually just find it easier use one device at a time, and disconnect when needing to change to keep the LDAC codec on. So, a bit of a novelty for me, but I can see how some people would like this function.

These headphones cancel out background noise amazingly well. Using the app, you can adjust the ambient noise level you need. Software also allows you to focus on vocal. When I don’t have music on, I don’t hear any weird hissing or noise, at least not so noticeable that it bugs me that I don’t have anything playing to zone it out. Great to use at work when I need to focus and not have any background noise catch my attention.

Now the app, there’s a lot of functions to play with, adaptive sound, etc., but I find the app can be finicky, and sometimes just freeze or linger on the “connecting” screen, when my headphones is already connected. Requires a restart a few times too many to my liking.
Overall, I enjoy these headphones a lot, I definitely would like some tweaks and changes, but these will more than enough suit my daily drivers.","March 18, 2021"
Grant Johnson,4,"Loved these headphones since the day I bought them. The ANC is great, sound quality is amazing, and they're comfortable enough to wear for hours. The only downside is the advertised battery life of 30+ hours is not what I have experienced. On average I will get somewhere between 19-23 hours of battery life which is still good but a little disappointing given what was advertised. Overall great product would buy again.","September 3, 2023"
cecile chabot,4,"The sound of these headphones are great. Love the noise cancelling and auto pause feature. I didn’t find the touch controls too sensitive and they worked well for me. The headphones were just too small for my head. The clamping was a little too loose and the shortest length was still a little too big for over my ears. To be fair, I have a small head! Would work for most people with an average-larger head size. One thing to note is that after a while the top of the headphones hurt my head after a while. This may be due to not fitting correctly, or just the cushioning on the headband. Unfortunately, I had to return this one.","August 11, 2023"
Gail Cole,4,"I bought this for a couple reasons, one to use in the night when I can’t sleep. I have one with a cord and didn’t want the cord when I slept. However, when it runs out of charge it will say shutting down and it wakes me up! My headset with the cord really doesn’t run out because it has a battery. So with that being said, I didn’t feel the charge lasted very long. You have to press the button to find out how much charge. My husband’s Bose tells you how much charge is left the minute you turn it on. Also I have a mini iPad, a regular iPad and my iPhone. Every time I want to use it, I have to shut down the Bluetooth on all the devices I have or it won’t open on the one I want. I will keep it, but find the headset with a cord is much more useful!","June 23, 2023"
B. Skip,4,"I've used these headphones for over 9 months now and when shopping, decided on these over the Bose brand. I really wanted to give these 5/5 stars but alas, this headset has touch controls for the majority of its functions instead of pressable buttons. If my fingers are cold or dry, the touch control panel does not work well although the last update seems to have improved the responsiveness.
The Plusses:
Nice compact travel case (I think that should be standard so I didn't include it below).
1) Can you say ""comfortable""?! I've worn these for 3-4 hours at a time working outside without 'hotspots' on my head or ears. And while they may not stay on if you're doing calisthenics, they'll stay on at a light-medium jog.
2) The battery is AMAZING!!: Two, 1hr-long conversations in a day and 4 hrs of music in between and the battery was at 40 percent by end of day. (This is after 9 months of use).
3) The range on the Bluetooth connection is about 50 feet so I can set the phone down on one side of the house and walk almost to the other side before it cuts out. This is the best range I've had in a headset that can make calls, and it's clear of ANY distortion until about 40 feet!
4) The headset aggressively connects to a previously paired device automatically which is EXACTLY what I want in a Bluetooth connection so I don't have to force it to connect from the menu and also has the ability to connect to two devices at once (not tested).
5) The sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancelling is fairly good (tested in cars, planes and other noisey environments: I've mowed the grass and used a leaf blower with them). I've tried 5 noise cancelling headsets, including 2 made for aviation: all of them have a slight hiss in the background which is the noise cancelling feature but this one is the QUIETEST! **See #5 for more sound details.
6) I love the app (after the last update): some improvement on the layout/responsiveness. If you forget how to use the touchpad, there is a tutorial page in-app (doesn't send you to a webpage, which is nice). **The premium audio features like ear-mapping and ambient sound control are great and are definitely worth setting up to get the best sound. Oh! And besides the equalizer feature, make sure you turn on Sony DSEE if you want your MP3s to sound better! (Be honest, that's most of our owned & streamed music, sadly). *This is NOT an 'audiophile' headset and does not provide the 'pure sound' experience of that type of high quality --think even more expensive--headset.
7) For the price (I think I got them on sale for $50 off), this is a GREAT headset!

Negative:
The ONLY thing I'm disappointed with is the headphone touch sensor. *I'm a manual-button guy and find that a pressable button wins every time over a touch pad (I prefer physical mice for computers and was sooo disappointed when Samsung got rid of the pressable home 'button' on their phones.
Anywho, if this headset had buttons for volume and seek controls, it'd be 5/5 stars and would be worth EVERY PENNY of the $350 pricetag.

At the time of writing this (5 July 21) I'd not gotten to test the headphones on a long call after installing the 9 June update which fixed some of the voice-call quality issues, so I can't comment on that.","July 6, 2021"
Justin,4,"These headphones are amazing. They sound so crisp and smooth, and the bass is deep without overpowering the higher notes, or using cheap tactics like haptic feedback. I bought these because my $100 noise cancelling headphones barely worked, and I could still hear my deaf grandfather screaming about politics upstairs.

My ONLY complaint: it will not turn itself off if you turn bluetooth on your phone off. They will simply stay on, not connected to anything, until they die. This is the only issue. Just remember to turn them off when you take them off, and they are the best headphones I've ever had.

Using the app with these headphones, you can adjust the noise cancellation very well. You can choose to hear quiet talk and the wind around you, or to barely hear someone screaming next to you. They have survived camping, work as an arborist, and several hikes. I have had these headphones for 2 years now and they are well worth the money. The battery life is also very good. Even if you accidentally run them dead (as I frequently do by forgetting to turn them off) it only takes 10 minutes to get 2 hours out of them. Perfect for a quick Gym visit. I am not a rich man, I sometimes pay my bills late. Still these headphones were worth it for my sanity.

I did tons of research into headphones before buying these, and they were absolutely the best quality for my money. I would recommend these to anyone willing to pay the price. My friends are always amazed by the audio quality when I let them try these headphones. Again, the only issue I've ever had is forgetting to turn them off.","April 27, 2023"
kyle martin,4,"I recently bought these to have a spare set of headphones - one for my work area and one for my bedroom. My other pair is the COWIN E7 active noise cancelling headphones. I have to say that this pair tops the COWIN in almost every area. My one complaint would be that there's a bit less padding on the headband portion.

Noise cancellation - works very well compared to the E7, ambient noise is pretty much inaudible and I find myself missing things like the microwave beeping in the same room, or somebody knocking at the door.

Sound - no complaints there, everything sounds good, especially with noise cancelling mode on

Bluetooth connectivity - there were some initial issues with connecting to my PC (motherboard has onboard bluetooth, ended up needing to use a dongle) but I had similar issues with the E7 as well. This pair connects much easier after getting that worked out than the E7

Comfort level - The ear cups are fairly comfortable, the headband could use a bit more cushioning, this is the only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5

Overall I'm pretty satisfied and if my other pair ends up needing replaced I'd probably buy again","July 25, 2023"
Matthew,4,"Take it from someone who has gone through 10+ headphones including: Beats Studio 2.0 + 3.0, Tzumis, Skullkandy, Sony xb950N1, Razors, iHome, and some others that I don't miss. My advice: spend the money and get these. I'll go through some quick pros and cons to keep things simple:

EDIT: had these for like 4 weeks and then the right earcup noise cancellation started crackling. Had to get a replacement. If these don't last, I'll start camping outside Sony Headquaters with a pitchfork.

Pros:
-Amazing Noise Cancellation- Supposedly the best in the industry. Definitely, the best I've owned. Far better than Beats FYI. Almost no hiss, just a sight wiss that is hard to notice. I've tried the Bose 700s at Best Buy and those do seem very good as well. I would say these are roughly even, with the Bose possibly edging them out. I think the Bose have zero hiss, however, I've never owned the 700s so I can't tell for sure. I think different headphones cancel out different sounds better too so I don't know if it's possible to name a sure winner.

-BASS (the one thing I know) - If you're someone who loves massive bass, these headphones do an excellent job. Far better than Beats. People say Beats are bass-heavy and they must be nuts cuz they have very little. The default sound setting on these isn't overly bass-heavy so if you aren't a bass fan then you'll be fine. You can adjust the bass settings in the app. Turn the clear bass to +10 if your a bass fan and you should be happy. The only headphones I've had that have more bass are the Sony xb950N1s, and they are very close. The N1s are solely dedicated to bass, so they manage a bit more punch, but don't have half the sound clarity or noise cancellation capabilities.

-Great Build- Just holding these you can tell they are well built and durable. They have a smooth rubberized feel that is very satisfying to the touch.

-Very Comfortable - They distribute the weight amazingly. No pressure points. I've worn these for hours. The most comfortable pair I own.

-Great carrying case

-Great Smart features- the most helpful are the pause sensor when you take them off your ears and then they shut off after a certain amount of time. Saves battery. I don't really use the speak-to-pause cuz I'm a fantastic singer and I don't want my headphones to pause when I release gold. ;)

-The multi-device pairing is pretty good. It's not overly fantastic for switching back and forth, rather it's nice to be able to pick up one of the two devices and not have to go to the setting to connect it.

-The touch features are decent, takes some tech awareness so recruit younger humans to teach you if you are 50+

Cons:
-I wish I could fire Karen from letting me know every time they turn on or connect to a device. They should have just used quick sounds or something like that, but an annoying lady lets you know when you do anything like turn them on/off, turn on noise cancellation, let your dog out, when you've lied to your parents, etc.

-Sony If you see this please fix this: the earcups turn the WRONG WAY. It's hard to explain but when you take them off your ears, the ear cups turn to face you. They should turn away so that you can set them down on a table/it would make it easy to put them in the case.

-That's honestly it. These aren't the cheapest but they are much better than their competitors and even rival headphones that sell starting at $550 and look like alien earmuffs.","December 19, 2020"
Colorado,4,"Have used other Sony in the past. These are impressive in the voice features and potential technology but the finger swipe sound and forward/reverse and pause is not fully functioning. At low sound with the noise cancellation there is a slight hiss - annoying - like listening to old cassette tapes, if you use pillows or lay down, any touch of the hand on the earpiece causes one of the functions to activate. I'm somewhat of an audiophile and while the sound is overall unimpressive, it feels wide in sound and is overwhelmed at times by the base (great for base lovers) but drives away a more bright clear sound, even with multiple EQ adjustments. The application seams like it was built by a high-schooler on a first time app build project - c'mon Sony - you can do better than that. The buttons/slides are tiny, it's hard to read, and appears poor in graphics, not to mention in actual function - and the earning badges to learn the features? C'mon Sony I'm not in first grade either. I've used lots of Sony headphones in the past, specifically for the crispness and clarity of true sound - have to say, the technology of the headphones seems to overrun already not impressive sound. Fit and feel is ok, but also allows sound to escape so was keeping my partner awake. What happened to the old ""you will not beat Sony again!"" -- going to other brands with higher hopes.","March 13, 2023"
Jeff Casperson,4,"i've listened to a friend's XM3 and demoed the XM2 at a store for quite a while a few years ago. But i finally decided to give the XM4 a chance and i'm happy i did.
These headphones have a ton of features, Speak to chat comes in handy at times, and i suspect will be more useful when i start traveling again. multipoint is nice, but i don't like that it's not available while using Sony's LDAC Codec. listening to the headphones in LDAC with local files stored on my SD card or via Amazon music HD really does add to the listening experience.
The ANC on these is really outstanding. I don't have the Bose 700 to compare, which is the model these will likely be compared to most for ANC, but the B&W PX7 doesn't disapoint in the ANC department, but is bested by the XM4. These headphones blocked out noises i didn't expect they would. for example, without music playing i stepped inside a bathroom and turned a ceiling fan and the water on at the same time. I could slightly hear the air passing through the fan, but couldn't hear the water running. With music at 30% i couldn't hear either at all, or someone talking near me, or the sound of my hands drumming on a counter top.
The headphones are very comfortable, are light weight and seem well built. i like the matte feel of the surface. The earpads i worry about, on the next model i'd like to see Sony improve the quality of them.
For calls, these will get the job done, but i found people were able to hear me better in different environments while using the Sennheiser momentum 3. That said, getting call quality right isn't a given and shouldn't be taken for granted. These do well and likely won't disapoint.
The touch panel on the right earcup is very responsive, and allows for Track navigation, volume control, accessing your digital assistant, and answering, ending and rejecting calls.
The default sound on the XM4 has a rolled off treble, mids that are present but not vibrant, and bass that has decent texture but lacks definition. I found the bright setting in the app to bring out the strengths of these headphones. The bass while at a lower level all throughout the bass region improves and while it isn't as dominant as it is in other EQ presets or via custom eq, i really like the feel of it. The mids across the board are full and help create a surprisingly good soundstage. Not so much in height, but definitely in width. Treble in this setting also sounds pretty natural and helps bring a wider more detailed soundscape to what ever you're listening to. These headphones don't do as well with speed, drums on metal and some prog tracks move through the drivers quickly and while things don't sound muddled, the bass drum hits just don't get the full detail they're asking for.

J. DeGraw,4,"After owning these headphones for a couple months now, I feel like I've landed on a firm four star review. One thing to consider is that this is the first pair of high performance noise cancelling headphones I've owned, so I don't have a lot to compare to.

The sound quality is incredible. From the deep bass, to the clarity of the treble, I've never owned another pair of headphones with this quality of sound. Sony advertises the 360 audio feature of these headphones, which I tested out (using the Deezer subscription). In my opinion, this feature isn't really worth it for music. It's almost more of an EQ function and a different way to listen to music (not necessarily better). If it worked for movies though, that could be a great use of surround sound, but to my knowledge that feature doesn't exist.

Having never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones before, I didn't quite know what to expect in this department. I think it's more accurate to call it noise ""dampening"" since they don't fully cancel out all sound. They do a really good job of cancelling ambient sound (I haven't had chance to test them on an airplane yet), but if people are talking or other random loud noises are going on, it will only partially cancel out those sounds. However, once you start listening to music, the noise cancelling works a LOT better. I'm able to sit at my computer listening to music while two kids play video games in the background and I hardly know they are there.

There are two reasons for the lack of a five star review though:

1. I had issues connecting to my PC. After setting up the headphones via the app on my phone, I tried connecting them to my desktop PC. They would only connect as an ""other"" Bluetooth device and would not receive any audio signal. After three weeks of troubleshooting and then reaching out to customer service, I found that I had to factory reset my headphones, then connect to the PC first, and my phone second. I can now switch between the two just fine. However, I now can't connect them to my laptop. I run into the same issue. I'm guessing I would have to factory reset them and then connect to the laptop first. All of this is kind of a pain and very frustrating to deal with on such an expensive piece of equipment.

2. The feature to connect to two devices at once is a really great idea and when it works, it's awesome. The problem is that it doesn't work well enough. If I am using the multi device connection (my phone and my PC), the audio breaks up on regular basis. My guess is that it's because the bandwidth is being split between two devices, and has a tendency to drop data more regularly. When I use the single device connection, I never run into this issue. Again, I would expect this feature to work a lot better with such an expensive pair of headphones.","November 3, 2020"
Joe Tzoumis,4,"I ordered black, but got the blue headphones.

They are comfortable and can be worn for hours. Seem kind of big even someone at work said they thought I was wearing ear muffs.

Wierd thing is there is a built in microphone, however the audio cord they supply with the head phones so you can also plug in to devices to use the headphones only does not have the functionality to allow for the microphone to be used if plugged in. I dont get why they wouldnt give you a audio cable with the 3rd ring that allows for voice to be transmitted through.

So if you want to be able to use these like with a gaming console or phone to talk, where the audio cable is needed, you will need to purchase a separate audio cable that allows for voice.","June 22, 2023"

America,4,"Sound quality is good, I’ve used them all the time for months. They are comfortable and they look pretty, just slightly more gray than in the pictures. However, My brother bought the Bose ones that are around the same price as these, and they feel sturdier with deeper base and sound. The one thing I did not like about my Sony headphones was that they slide right off when I bend over while I brush my teeth or do some stretches, I adjust it as tight as I can but they keep sliding. Is it my ears? I don’t really think so, whenever I borrow the Bose ones they feel pretty firm and steady in my head, like as if they were a part of me and they do not fall. Bose also looks slimmer and less bulky on your head, but the Sony ones are more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. If you want Sony for the gym I would say think again and get the Bose instead. But if not, you will not really regret getting these. Also the fact that these headphones automatically go silent for like 15 seconds whenever you speak with them over your head can get annoying. 4/5 stars","April 30, 2023"
Aidan Fischer,4,"I've had these for a little over a year and they still have great battery life and sound quality, but the touch screen panel is a big downside. It can be inconsistent, and it has a tendency to accidentally activate its ""Speak-to-Chat"" mode, which mutes your audio whenever someone speaks nearby. Unfortunately there's no way to fully get rid of this setting without completely turning off the touch screen panel as well. The sound/build quality and the overall comfort of the headset is great though, and they have great charge time/battery life :)","July 5, 2023"
Ata,4,You can’t use LDAC codec on iPhone and the sound quality gets noticably worse when you use AAC instead. But I found out the mic quality is way better on iPhone than android so keep in mind.,"August 30, 2023"
Amazon Customer,4,"I finally splurged and bought these headphones when they went on sale on Amazon. I wanted to replace my cheap Bluetooth wireless headphones that I bought on Amazon a couple of years ago.
I've always liked Sony electronics and after reading and looking at many reviews about these headphones and Sony's newest headphones I decided on these headphones.
They came well packaged and relatively quickly from Amazon. These headphones are light weight and feel good on my head and my ears. I truly don't get the ear fatigue that I got with the other headphones. Additionally, the battery life is excellent and as advertised.
The sound, which is a pretty subjective thing, is excellent. The bass is good without being hitting me over the head heavy bass. I mainly use these headphones to listen to tv at night so as not to wake the rest of the household. I do not and don't intend to use these for receiving or making phone calls. I will use them on the rare occasion to listen to my IPHONE when traveling or in a public setting and don't want to disturb others.
There are two main issues for me that kept me from giving these headphones a 5-star rating. They constantly cut out when I cough or clear my throat and I assume it's a function of the phone call making/receiving. They also will quit working and it got so bad that I had to use my old, wired Sony headphones, which sound great but a pain in the --- because of the cord. I was able to get through to a Sony representative and we rebooted my Sony OLED TV and the headphones once again worked but I am clueless as to why they quit in the first place.
Are these the most expensive wireless headphones out there? No, not even close but they aren't the cheapest either. So time will tell if I have a wonky pair of headphones or a wonky Sony TV.","August 8, 2022"
Chukuka O.,4,"I wanted to put a detailed description and review. However, I think being as short and concise will be the best.

I sleep my head near a portable AC in a small room. I put these MX4s on and 98% of the protable AC sound disappears. This thing can cancel noise. I won't deny that 10/10.

Now let's get to the sound quality. Before I had these, I had the Sony WHCH700N. Alone with no app. The 700N sound bad compared to the MX4. The 700N tend to be more on the sharp side on default compared to the well rounded MX4.

Now once I use the app with both, The 700N BEATS the MX4 in sound. I would say the 700N is about 25% better than the MX4 once the app is used. I'll tell you why.

Remember how I said that by default the 700N is on the sharp side with the high pitch parts of the noise like bells, guitars, pianos, etc being clear and sharp? Well with the app you can put the bass up and lower the sharpness a bit. This gives a very CLEAN BASS it flows so well with the voices front and center. Giving a very clean feeling.

When compared to the MX4, the MX4 bass sounds muddy and drowns out ALL of those highs. In turn this makes the voice sound like it's behind the bass. Giving an overall muddy sound in my opinion. No matter how much I adjusted the sound, I could not get those highs to make noise in the MX4. The bass in the 700N were so clear, that you could hear it continue to reverb in the song. While the MX4 the bass would punch your ear but end before the full range.

I won't return them because the noise cancelling is what I needed. However, sound wise, it's not the best and anybody who says this trash sounds good I have to question them.

I think the problem comes that the 700N the app REALLY lets me control the sound of it. While the MX4, it's like no matter what I do on there, the sound barely changes.

The MX4 starts/feels warm. Once we use the app it stays warm no matter what I change.

While the 700N starts cool and crisp, Once I use the app, I can keep the crispness while adding the warmth of the bass. Giving me everything except noise cancelling. NOISE CANCELLING COMPARED TO THE MX4 is 5%.....

Let me repeat that. The WHCH700N noise cancelling is only 5-10% of what the MX4 does. Meaning the noise cancelling on the 700N is non-existent. Now you know why I won't return these lol.","June 28, 2021"

Cherry,4,"The sound leaks, even though I looked into them before buying. But it doesn't bother me too much because I got them for doing homework at home. The only person who would hear my music is my husband. Also, the headphones aren't as snug as I'd like and aren't good for wearing to the gym. It's possible that I have a smaller head, but the headphones don't stay on during workouts unless it's a light one like walking.","August 16, 2023"
P Burton,4,"I'm not an audiophile. These headphones are great: Easy to use, long battery life, great sound, and quick to connect to Bluetooth—love that I can connect to two devices at once and easily switch between other devices via the app. Only annoying thing is that there is occasionally a blip when the Bluetooth randomly drops fro a second, happens far more frequently when connected to my Visio tv.

Noise cancellation is good, not great in that they do not do a particularly great job of filtering out voices—two work-from-home employees working without walls. Adequate, not great.","July 27, 2023"
Chris,4,"I've had the WH1000XM3's for quite some time and I used them almost exclusively for flights as the noise cancellation is from another world. Recently I've been getting more into computer gaming the XM3's aren't all that great in terms of compatibility for gaming on Windows. But I was playing Battlefield and I was blown away with how amazing the sound quality was. I ended up jumping to buy the XM5's (which were disappointing from a sound quality perspective compared to the XM3's). The XM4's were identical in form factor to the XM3's so I thought there would be improvement in compatibility and sound quality.

The sound quality of the XM4's were actually slightly improved with an extreme loss of bass. Now the bass is much clearer but less punchy. Punchy is what i was going for. In terms of compatibility, the XM4's have the ability to connect to 2 devices simultaneously which is a welcome feature as an office worker. But on the computer, especially for gaming, I would have an issue where the game would connect to the microphone enabled audio channel leaving the audio quality horrendously bad. But I've read that this is an issue for most prime time headphone makers as these headphones were designed for consuming media, not for gaming or calling.

Microphone quality is greatly improved over the XM3's but I still wouldn't use it for work calls.

Would I recommend these? Yes! I did end up returning mine because the XM3's were better for what I wanted. With a wired connection, all of my PC problems seem to have gone away on both the XM3's and XM4's.","October 12, 2022"
Erik daguerre,4,"Overall this is a solid noise canceling headset. I've been using the Bose quiet comfort for about 3 years and one of the speackers finally died so I need something new. Due to poor reviews for the Bose 4.5 I went with this set. I really enjoy the pause when taking the headset off, or when talking. That is an extremly nice feature. Though the speak to puase should only be turned on when you are in a place it will be used, else if you talk to yourself it will drive you crazy.

The detection to adjust level of noise canceling between sitting standing running or on transport was annoying at first. Remember to adjust each state to your level of noise canceling. Once I did that it works great.

This headset does have more bass then Bose, which is a nice change, it is not omg for base heads. But just enough to make music or watching films more enjoyable. So its just right to me at least.

This head set is really comfortable I've worn them for around 12 hours and usually forget I have them on, and much lighter then the Bose quiet comfort series.

The sony app for the headset could be a little more user friendly, but over all its not horrible. just a few options that are a pain to remember where they are and how to get to them. (The location setting stuff)

The widget option for andriod is nice. so you can easly keep track of your current battery life noise canceling level and what equalizer setting you are on.","September 30, 2022"
Ryan Sutton,4,"Love the sound quality. Have always loved Sony.

The problem is that every so often i have to reset the device because its noise canceling will randomly constantly turn off while in use. While this normally wouldn't be an issue if i could still hear the audio, if the sound canceling is on and suddenly is turned off, then the whole audio shuts off for around 20 seconds. While bearable since it works fine after resetting, its very annoying.","August 21, 2023"
Fritz Largosa,4,"Owned the WH1000xm4 for a week. Thought the sound was great for a noise cancelling headphone, however if you don’t care for noise cancelling you can get better sounding bluetooth headphones for an even lower price, from Hifiman, Grado to name a few. I bought the Bose 700 a few days later. Sound quality is close between the two. The Bose sounded warm and neutral while Sony sounded a little lean and neutral. With the Bose you are sitting a little closer to the performer because voices sound closer to you, with Sony you are sitting a few rows back with a little wider soundstage. I would say Sony has a little better bass impact compared to the Bose. For a noise cancelling headphone at this price range I would give both a 9/10 in sound quality. However, compared to my $1700 Sennheiser HD800S, both would get a 5.5/10 if the HD800S was a 10. These are not audiophile headphones but sound good enough for non-critical listening.

Both are very comfortable, Sony is cushier, while Bose has a little firmer foam around the ears. Because the Sony is cushy with more surface area contact, your ears can feel warmer, good if you live in a cold area I guess. With this one I prefer the Bose.

Sony has more functionality with its phone app. However, Sony’s AI algorithm DSEE which is supposed to enhance compressed audio cause some loss in audio fidelity. Overall better with it off, at least with my ears. Music untouched and played as close to neutral as possible is best. Sony has a built in Noise Canceling Optimizer which made no audible difference to my ears. These are probably unfinished functionality pushed by the marketing department. I’m not sure. Before I bought this headphone, I was reading a review from Soundguys website where they tested battery life. Anyway, these got just below 20 hrs, not 30. So on par with other brands.

I would have kept the Sony, was happy with it. However, it wasn’t compatible with my Samsung TV(2019 model). Searched online and a few people have the same issue. Noticeable audio lag, and loss of sync between audio and video. With a firmware update from Sony, this will probably be fixed in the future, but I didn’t want to take a chance, especially considering the price of the headphone. So anyway, bought the Bose 700, now zero issues with my tv. Sound quality is identical, build quality and choice of materials is just as good. Final Rating. Sound Quality 9, Build quality 9, Noise Cancellation 9, Comfort 8.5.","October 21, 2020"
Kay,4,"These headphones have incredible noise cancelling and sound quality. The noise cancelling is very impressive, with these on I can't hear the kids on my street playing loudly outside my house. Sound quality is great. I gave it four stars instead of five because I find them a bit heavy. I have a big head and I do feel the weight of these within an hour of use. It's not terrible and other lighter headphones I've had (like the Bose QC45s) are less comfortable because they don't have as good of padding. So yeah great headphones, just wish they were a little more lightweight.","May 21, 2023"
768364789267525,4,"I don't know if it's the noise cancelling tech or the extended bass caused by it being a truly well fitting over ear headphone, but I listen to a lot of bassy music, and every time I wear these for longer than 1 hour, I end up with medically significant vertigo attacks (BPPV.)

I have never had this happen from any other phones, and it could be a byproduct of aging. I don't expect this to deter anyone else from buying, as this is a rare side-effect, and frankly these are awesome (and I have worked a lot in sound so I have owned like 40 pairs of phones) and these are exceptionally good. Maybe so good that they rattle the balance right out of my inner ear.

Noise cancelling is interesting if frivolous (I don't care for the feature and I distrust weird psychoacoustic engineering) and the fit for a large head (mine) is exceptional compared to a lot of full over ear closed back phones that seem to be made for women or kids. Guys with ~size 8 hats: these are good.

I've spent a lot of time mixing music and these are not typical flat EQ mixing cans but they are not exaggeratingly bassy or loud either, could conceivably acclimate to using them for a mixing function if you use reference material. Especially since using BT is so superior to mixing with a wire. And the sound of a good BT5 kit is still more accurate than the summing effect of running wired phones through AD/DA to an analog mixer.

The BT5 is solid, it's kind of problematic how they arbitrarily seem to negotiate autoconnect between previously paired devices, but that's liveable.

Honestly I might just keep using them even if they make me dizzy and sick, because who wants a life without music? Better to be stumbling around instead. Drunk people do it all the time.","June 30, 2022"
LaceeB2016,4,Okay so I listen to heavy metal music and sometimes the music sounds distorted and the bass in these are none existent. But I kinda didn’t buy them for that I bought them for the noise cancellation. I drive drift cars. So if you YouTube drift cars they are noisy and loud. I can drive and not hear my car in these while my Apple Watch is losing its mind telling me I’m going to go deaf. So to me it’s worth it!,"June 4, 2023"
Kyra,4,"I've had these for a few months now and I love them. I mainly bought them for the noise canceling, which works amazing for what I needed, but the sound quality is great too. Before messing with the EQ they have sort of a muddy, bass-heavy sound which I don't care for. This was an easy fix though and I was able to get it to sound how I like in the headphones app.

The only issue I've had so far is sometimes I get a crackling noise if I use them for few hours, but it goes away when I turn them off and back on. I've seen some people say it's an issue with the noise canceling and humidity, which makes sense since I live in a humid area. It doesn't happen often enough for it to bother me, so I've kept them.

Overall, pretty good and they work great for what I got them for.","April 5, 2023"
Palesart,4,"After doing a lot of research I was quite excited to receive my Xm4’s and give them a go. I’m not an audiophile or anything, but the headphones sound great! Though I’ve had some old V-Modas that are about 8 years old now and personally I couldn’t tell too much of a difference in sound quality.

The ANC is great, no complaints there. Though these were my first pair of ANC headphones and I knew I was paying a premium for that. Personally I just found that ANC wasn’t nearly what it was hyped up to be, and while it’s a really cool feature I personally don’t need it in headphones.

Sound quality is great, great bass and sounded crispy enough for my average ears.

Now why give it a lower review? At this premium price I guess I was expecting a little better build quality from the headphones. I was so excited when I opened that box but something about the cheap and hollow feeling plastic just irked me to no end. I’m a very tactile person almost to a fault, and build quality is important to me. Personally these feel like they wouldn’t last more than 2 years until something happened to them, they just feel so flimsy! And after reading a lot of reviews and occurrences of hinges breaking or adjustment sliders wearing down, I decided to return them.

My girlfriend who cares much less for build quality was shocked when I told her how much I paid for them, and she was right. For $350 I guess I just expect a bit more effort into the materials, (or at least some metal hinges!!).

Conclusion:
Great sound and ANC, features are great and I HIGHLY suggest changing the EQ settings when you get them, it’s night and day once you get your settings right.

For $350, I expected much higher build quality, those plastic hinges just worries me about the longevity of these.

If build quality is less of an issue, go for these! They’re great! Worth the price? That’s up to you. Personally I found these headphones a bit overhyped, there’s a lot of good cheaper options.

If someone else is like me and loves build quality perhaps a little too much, look for some other options in this price range. You may sacrifice some features but how many features do headphones truly need outside of sounding good?","September 10, 2021"
Duran W.,4,"I like nice immerse base in my music. II lost my previous headphones and needed replacements for an upcoming trip.. I read some reviews saying that the XM4’s have no bass, so to see for myself I purchased the XM4’s and the 910N EXTRA BASS headphones. IMO the claims that the XM4’s have no bBASS is BASELESS. They have plenty of bass adjustable by the EQ. The bass on the XM4’s are more immerse than the 910N’s which are all bass and thumpy or muddy to me. My only complaint about the XM4’s is that towards the end of my trip the volume seemed to wane a bit. The flight was 4 plus hours long and I didn’t use them the entire time. I primarily listen to r&b, hip hop, slow jams, even yacht rock. The noise cancelling is probably the best I’ve experienced. The sound quality on the XM4’s is really good so I’m going to play around with them and try and figure out the volume thing and get my custom EQ just where I want them.. but again… these are some really good headphones.","November 27, 2022"
Jonathan J Kim,4,"I have been using Sony XM4 for over a year and a half. I have recently upgrade my workstation to AMD 5900X with 6900XT. Spent $2000 on it. Ever since I have upgraded and installed Windows 11 I have been constantly losing Bluetooth connection between Windows 11 and Sony XM4. It is very frustrating.

I had not had problem with older system with Windows 10. It happened with Windows 11. I do not have the same issue with Mac nor my iPhone. It only happens with Windows 11 on my newly built AMD 5900X.

I just can not find any fix but there are many otherr who reports the same problem. I have a cheap Bluetooth Audio adapter, it works fine on Windows 11. This seems to be specifically Sony XM4 problem.

I can not get any resolution to this. I can do a walkaround by switching audio or turning Bluetooth on and off. But it does not fix. It just gets me audio for a bit and drops again. Sony I believe has a driver problem on XM4.

* Update : I found the source of the problem. It is the Sony feature ""Connect to 2 devices simultaneously"" That feature was not working properly with Windows 11. With that turned off Sony did not disconnect from source anymore. I hope they fix it because it is a nice feature to be able to switch between iPhone and Windows 11 automatically.","January 14, 2023"
Alex Bigzaad,4,Noise cancellation is perfect but the sound quality is not that good compared to my other brand headsets,"September 6, 2023"
Rene,4,"The app that comes with this makes them very smart when it comes to noise cancelation and the sound quality is impeccable even when they are Bluetooth. Very fast charging. Haven't tested them enough to know whether or not the 30-hour battery holds up but they do seem to drain pretty slow.

Notification sounds from the phone can be a little obtrusive and annoying, especially if you have a digital assistant turned on, but all that stuff can be turned off. I'd rather there be a function to just lower the volume of the notifications or to just keep the assistant from talking as much. However, it does recognize when you are ignoring the notifications and will eventually turn off the voice and just do the notification sound.

The voice isolation feature with the ambient noise turned all the way up is not really quite enough to be able to hold a decent conversation while music is playing even with the music turned all the way down. It's more for just being able to tell that someone is talking to you. If you want to be able to talk to people without taking them off you really HAVE to put on the speak to chat, and speak to chat is a bit slow to react so you always end up having to ask the person to repeat their first sentence when they talk to you, and the timer for how long speak to chat stays on is somehow both too long and too short. It always turns on too soon when you are talking and takes too long when you aren't. TBH if you want to talk while wearing them you are best off using the palm over the ear feature to pause the music immediately and turn on all ambient sound to max. BUT if you are more concerned with just being able to generally tell what's going on around you rather than holding a conversation the smart noise cancellation is actually really good at adjusting to changes in the environment all making sure to make you aware of important noises.

I will say though that these are really nitpicks in a very very high-quality pair of headphones. Additional notes, not sure why it says it doesn't have a mic when it does, and for those who care it actually has 360 audio. You'll have to pay for a service or something that provides 360 music, but it is a feature that is not mentioned on the amazon page.","November 29, 2020"
Jologskyblues,4,"Pros (mainly quality of life refinements compared to the XM3):

1. Auto play and pause music when I remove and put back on the headphones just like on the AirPods.
2. Auto ambient sound mode when speaking.
3. Touch gesture sensors on the right ear cup seem to have been improved over the XM3 being that they're more responsive, however, I still get the occasional missed or wrong gesture input.
4. Can now connect to my iPhone and Sony NW-A45 simultaneously so I can control the EQ using my phone and hear the effect on the music being played back by the DAP.
5. The XM3 was a skin oil fingerprint magnet. Not so with the XM4
6. The Sony Connect app is nice and fully featured and has improved over time with updates.
7. Sony seems to have fixed the ANC sound glitch that I had with the XM3 which happens whenever the headphone's fit slightly shifts when I'm walking or moving my head/jaws as well as when doors are suddenly opened or closed. I'm guessing it was a combination of firmware ANC optimizations as well as having slightly larger and thicker ear pads and increased clamping force therefore improving the seal and stability of the fit compared to the XM3.
8. I'm not sure if it's because the XM4 is still brand new but it seems to have better build quality to the XM3 which creaked at the headband joints. The Bose QC35II still has better build quality and wearing comfort though.
9. I love the design and it's nicely lightweight.

Cons:
1. Not the best sound quality IMO. I had to set the ""Clear Bass"" EQ setting to -5 because the XM4 is way too bassy and somewhat muffled sounding overall, just like the XM3. They do not have the balanced, refined, detailed yet relaxed sound of the AirPods Pro.
2. ANC has a very audible hissing noise on the right channel that can be heard during quiet or minimal musical passages and songs. The Bose QC35II also had this while the AirPods Pro does not. The XM3 on the other hand, had ANC hiss on both stereo channels but were subtle enough to live with.
3. ANC still has that cabin pressure feeling that my AirPods Pro doesn't have.
4. The ear cups are still not roomy enough for my ear size.
5. The ear cups are feel hot and are uncomfortable to wear in hot, sweaty days.","December 29, 2020"
D.N.,4,"I've owned a pair of WH1000XM2s for about 3 years now and they are by far one of the best sets of headphones I've purchased. Thought maybe it was time to upgrade them to the latest and greatest--after all, I'd heard that the XM3s managed to have even better sound quality and noise-canceling ability, so the XM4s must be exceptional. And they do sound amazing, their noise-canceling is excellent, and the fit is nearly the same as the XM2s except with a little more space in the ear cup. But are they that much better to warrant spending $260+ on an upgrade?

The answer, I decided, is no.

And if you're coming from an XM3 then the answer must be 100% no. The only major feature that could be called a game-changer is the dual connection option. The sound quality is maybe 10-15% better than the XM2s at the most, but I doubt most people would be able to tell the difference. Coming from the XM3s, I'm sure it must be practically indistinguishable. The noise-canceling ability coming from the XM2s is the same to my ears. I could still hear the same high-end sounds coming through that I could on my XM2s, and I've read more than one review complaining that in AB testing the noise-canceling is actually slightly worse on the XM4s because of the increased distance between the ear pad and ear. So, in the end I decided to send them back. And using my XM2s again I definitely noticed no appreciable difference.

If you're a first time buyer you really can't go wrong with these headphones. The XM series have improved my quality of life in many different ways, specifically in removing distractions and stress in a noisy environment, and ending the irritation of cables (once you go wireless you'll never be able to go back). If you're thinking of upgrading from a perfectly fine working set of XM2s or XM3s, save your money and wait for the next iteration that has major changes--the next generation of processing chip, the addition of water resistance, etc.","December 4, 2021"

I like the look of the headphones, the sound quality is exceptional, and the noise canceling and adaptive sound features are great.","July 2, 2023"

It also fits well, but it does feel a little heavy but you’ll get used to it eventually. The speaker has a really good quality. The only thing that I didn’t really like is that when you increase the sound, before it reaches halfway, of what you’re listening to, people around can hear it around you.","April 19, 2023"
Greg S,4,"3.5 stars. Tried these vs the Bowers & Wilkins PX7s. These won. I'm not satisfied with Bluetooth audio solutions.

Let's talk LDAC. Sony advertises this supposedly awesome codec *if* your device supports it. Guess what? Mac OS doesn't support LDAC. Windows 10 doesn't support LDAC. My iPhone doesn't support LDAC. I can get some kind of 360 audio support *if* I switch my music service from Spotify to another, more expensive service like Amazon Music, Deezer, or Tidal and *if* I use my phone as my primary audio device (and even then only if I switch to an Android?).

Bluetooth headphones aren't great; let's not kid ourselves. If you're looking for a great sounding pair of headphones -- whether you use them on the go or not -- then don't buy a pair of wireless cans. Instead, spend the $400 you'd have to drop for these on a decent headphone amp and a wired set of cans. My BeyerDynamic DT770 Pro's were amazing and some day I will buy another (or a nicer) set.

Why did I rate these over the B&W PX7s? I need headphones that I can wear at work and talk into, and have people hear me. The Sonys shine for that purpose. The long battery life and all of the microphones built into them make sure I can talk to people all over the world in these godawful Zoom meetings we're all stuck in these days. I can go through meetings from the moment I get to work to the moment I leave.

Besides LDAC support for real devices, sorely needed upgrades for these would be a MacOS app on top of the standard iPhone app, some velour pads as an upgrade option over the ""leather"" pads they come with, and if you're reading this, Sony, a charge cable longer than six inches. At $400 for the pair, the least you could do is include a 1or 2 meter charging cable.","April 12, 2021"
Monirom,4,"New users should know that as great as these headphones are, there is one pro/con to the wireless SONY WH-1000XM4. Specifically, you need to download the SONY Headphones App to manage pairing the headphones to a new device. iPads, iPhones, Laptops etc. So if you ever find yourself without your phone but need to pair the headphones to a new device, you're out of luck — as manual pairing (if you have a lot of Bluetooth devices relegates you to the normal frustrations of Bluetooth pairing.) Use of the app is a good thing as it’ll save your sanity and make it easier to connect/reconnect to the intended devices.
…
UPDATE: While you need the SONY Headphones app to manage your headphones, after a few weeks with them I am immensely enjoying the ability to switch to new devices on the fly. This is possible because the app remembers which devices you’ve connected to - and allows you to reconnect while simultaneously being connected to the phone.
…
The advantage here is the headphones pair with my intended device and switching is seamless. No longer will you headphones connect to another device, besides the intended, because that device was closer/had a stronger Bluetooth signal.
…
It definitely pays to spend sometime with the headphones app - so you not only understand all of the awesome SONY features - but you can also disable the features you don’t like for a more customizable experience.","August 25, 2022"
ap cosmos,4,"This product works exactly as intended. If your a music producer or composer then these headphones are great if your working in a noisy area. The noise cancelling feature works great but struggles to cancel only one sound which is the human voice. At most other people voices will sound muffled but arguing and yelling will cut right through the noise cancelling.

The app works great too as it monitor and configure the headphones to best suit the area that your in to maximize your experience. You can even do calls and talk through the headphones along with other things if you want which also makes them great for work if you want to use them that way. I love bass and all but these headphones are quite bass heavy which is great if your just listening to music but I wouldn't mix and master music with them. The battery life on these things is insane lasting for over a week if you are using them every day or every other day. The charging cord though is extremely short to the point of that it's a bit silly.","September 19, 2022"
SZee,4,"Checks all the boxes for a high quality wireless ANC headphone for air travel. OMG, no more screaming kids, or engine rumbles. You can listen to movies without blowing your eardrums out. Form factor is great for foldability and a small storage case. Audio quality is pretty good. It may not be audiophile level, but it's quite satisfying, especially if you make some equalizer adjustments. I probably won't use it enough for the inevitable shoe to drop... ANC feedback screech. (see other reviews), but it hasn't happened to me yet. Got it on sale when the new model M5 came out (closeout sale?), but Sony changed their minds and decided to continue offering the M4. Current price is only $50 less than the M5... warum? At this price, only 4 stars.","February 18, 2023"
Jeeper,4,"So I got these after my bose 700 headset failed outside of its warranty. I was reluctant to purchase a new bose, because they're expensive, and well so are these. But these are 100 dollars less, so I grabbed a pair. I will say that I found the comfort of the bose to be much better. I can literally wear them all day. These...I wear them for a few hours to watch a movie or two and I have to take them off. I don't know what it is exactly, but I can't wear them for an extended period. That being said, the software they use for this headset is awesome, and I absolutely love that it automatically pauses whatever I am listening to or watching when I remove them, and the use per charge is amazing. I usually use them atleast a couple hours a day, sometimes more, on and off through the day, and I'll maybe charge them once a week, sometimes 2 weeks between charges. But all that aside...I would love for them to be more comfortable. My bose 700s I would often use just to cancel out noise, this was amazing when I was driving a reefer. At night I'd lay in the bunk and put on the bose 700s and it would tone the noise so far down you could barely hear it. If you were watching a movie, or listening to music, you couldn't hear the refer at all. I would not dare to sleep with these Sony headphones, I tend to get headaches if I leave them on too long, while with the bose, I wore them when I had migraines to lessen my pain. They're good, but they could be better. Are they worth the money, yes most certainly. Great sound, good quality. But not as comfortable as they should be.","October 19, 2021"
T_Mc,4,"I bought this headset because I heard and got to experience the Sony WH-1000XM3 a few months ago and I liked the way the XM3 felt when on my head and sounded along with its features.

As a treat to myself, I purchased the Sony WH-1000XM4. The sound is real good whether music, tv or movies. I have not tried a phone call yet. I have it connected to my phone and my TV. This worked great between the two when I got it setup.

A feature that is a concern is the sound pause feature/sensor when someone is talking to you. It responds awesomely by pausing and changing the ambient sound. However, if you hum or sing with a song, the headset pause the music/sound due to your own voice. Annoying!!! If you turn the feature off, you can hum/sing the songs. However, when someone tries to communicate with you, you will not hear them. When you get eye contact, you have to take the headset off because the noise canceling feature is working awesomely... it tunes out the outside sounds. The other option is to not hum or sing. It may have something to adjust that I have not mastered yet. It's not a game stopper though. Just a learning curb.

The touch censor is something you have to get used to. It works pretty well once you get used to pausing, fwd/rev a song, and vol control.

Another concern I have is the cushion; it does not breathe too well. I had to do a little yard work and began to perspire. I had to lay the headset out to dry when I was done because the cushions were damp/wet.

Overall, this is a pretty good headset. The features, you have to learn and adjust accordingly (something I am still working on doing). There are a couple of flaws (my opinion) I mentioned... ear cushions getting wet and the overly sensitive reaction when you are humming or singing. I would give these a 8 out of 10. Nothing is perfect but I am sure the next gen will have more improvements.","December 8, 2020"
Trimontium,4,"Solid headphones, don't like volume control, I know it's class 2 bluetooth but other class 2's seem to have slightly longer range than these. It's too easy to just mute instead of lower volume.","July 11, 2023"
Engi_Nerd,4,"Headphones are all about compromise, like most things in life. I have several sets for different use cases and these are the most expensive, though not by much. It's important to realize that a good chunk of the money you spend on these is not going to sound quality, per se. You're paying for good battery life, good noise cancelling, decent build quality, multi-device wireless radios, the speak-to-mute trick, and the new proximity sensor. Sound quality is subjective, but I found it awful with the EQ off and didn't like any of the presets. I took me two days to find a setting I was just okay with and the sound is kinda bad in comparison to my wired B&O H6s. I personally even like my Jaybird Vistas more, though those fatigue my ear canals during extended use. That said, I fully expected this as they are all about comfort and active cancellation for noisy environments and in these categories they are great. The feeling of putting them on and suddenly being in your own bubble of quiet is very cool, but again, that's what you're paying for. The talk to mute function is very cool, but is slightly pointless because it's frankly just rude to talk to people with your headphones still on.

Pros:
+Crazy Bluetooth range. No dropouts in normal use
+Noise cancelling is nice. Not earth shattering but nicely tamps down common humming noise like HVAC
+ Speak to mute works well and is very useful.
+Multi device support is awesome and works pretty well
+Comfort is decent

Cons:
-Sound quality is just OK.
-The proximity sensor that's supposed to pause and shut them off doesn't always work
-The swipe controls are hot garbage. Sony should be able to afford a proper dial at this price point.
-Battery life is highly variable depending on what you have enabled.
-The added pressure from the active noise cancelling fatigues my ears, but that is likely a personal thing.

Takeaway: I am not personally sure these are better than passive noise isolating buds like the Vistas, that I feel have comparable or better sound quality. They are definitely more versatile however.","September 30, 2020"
Miguel,4,"I really liked this product but did not end up keeping them for several reasons, but first off I’ll list some things that I like: good build quality, comfortable, stylish, nice colors, and a good app to adjust settings/equalizer. As for the things I didn’t like: the sound quality. By no means was the sound quality bad but they were way overhyped. I prefer my airpods over these for ease of use and sound quality. Another thing that is slightly annoying is they don’t like to stay on your head unless your head is straight up. So running or laying down on the bench press they fall off. The bass was very underwhelming, but it awful. Lastly I returned the product because it was missing the charging cable. I would rate this a 3.5/5 if that was an option.","February 12, 2023"

Usually I get motion sick / nauseous from noise cancellations, but with these I can wear them for hours and feel awesome. I’m still working on adjusting the best sound settings (out of box they kind of sound bad but you MUST adjust). Once I tweaked it they’re AWESOME. I hear background vocals in songs I’ve never heard before. I look cool when I wear them, quality is incredible, sound is the best I’ve personally ever heard. 10/10 recommend to all my friends and then some.","March 8, 2023"
Anonymous Coward,4,"They run quite a while on a charge—more than a day—and are more comfortable than most over ear headphones.

Bluetooth range is better than most. Connection was easy to make and stable. It connects to two devices. A nit is that it will play from neither device until both have connected or it’s given up on one.

Their app is…not good. But you don’t really need it. Every few months, I accidental enable a feature on the headset that I don’t remember how to turn off. Then I fire up the app, fiddle with disconnecting and reconnecting, turn the feature off, and ignore the app again.","February 27, 2023"
Rondi Werner,4,"Much better noise cancelling than my old Bose headphones. Great for air travel, though I mostly use it for video calls. Bluetooth pairs easily with my MacBook and my Windows workstation.

This device delivers good quality audio and microphone functionality during video calls, whether at home or in an open workplace. Earphones are lightweight and comfortable, even on long calls. I like being able to stay connected to audio when I step away from my computer to warm up my coffee or close a window.

I would have given these headphones five stars, but the ridiculously short 8-inch charging cord is useless. I had to buy a longer cord that could actually reach my charging port.

Headphones automatically turn off when they are not being worn in order to save battery life. This is my second pair; the first ones lasted three years of almost daily use. In my experience, the highest endorsement is a repeat purchase.","January 9, 2023"
Kirby,4,"So I LOVE the brand. They just make quality products. I bought these to mainly use as a headset for work while on calls with my Pixel 5. I had tried the airpod pros but because of the codec issue, it simply wasn't a fit. These use APTx so I was in luck. Point being, call quality, ability to stay connected across multiple devices and battery life were my factors.

Call quality seemed to be ok. Same with microphone. Sound quality seemed to be above average when listening to anything other than calls. Although I do not have a trained ear.

The issues I had were strange. I could only get it to charge past 60% a few times no matter how long I left it on there. Using OEM cable, and a Pixel box, an Ipad box and a normal generic one. Software from them read phone was at 60% despite being on the charger all night. (Minimum 7 hours) The issue with this, is as a high call user, once it hits 20% it starts reminding you to charge battery. And doesn't stop until you do. Super annoying.

The other issue was when noise cancellation was on or off, and I am driving....I could not be on a call. It picked up so much noise that other people would get annoyed of the noise. That isn't how it is supposed to work.

The biggest issue was strange. I use these with my laptop for Zoom calls etc. The problem is when in Headset mode and not Stereo when connected to Windows 10, they would stop whatever I was listening to or watching after exactly 5 seconds. Bluetooth troubleshoot fixed...Temporarily. If I switched to Stereo, then I had no sound.

I like them and may have possibly have gotten a bad set. But I ended up returning and buying the Sony MX4 which I have loved thus far","February 5, 2021"

When I am working out if my arm touches the control panel it does everything but play music. The app wants to know what I am doing at all times. The charging chord is the size of my pinky. Now that I am committed I can’t help but think if there are better headphones out there maybe even ones that are as nice that don’t drain my bank account.","March 15, 2023"
Paul Eubanks,4,"I really like how these headphones sound and perform. I have a white noise machine I tested with and it mostly disappears entirely when noise cancelling is on, save for a few very small frequency areas. The sound quality of the drivers is pretty great also. The only issue i have is during extended listening sessions, the headband is a bit uncomfortable, I think because the area where it contacts your head is too thin. If they had a wider headband it would feel more comfortable for long listening sessions. I have a set of Beyerdynamic DT770s I use in my studio and the headband is over an inch wide. It never feels fatiguing because it covers a bigger surface area of your head. The Sony headband is maybe half that width, and the smaller surface area means the weight is concentrated over a smaller area. You could maybe improvise some padding to alleviate this somewhat. For instance the Beyerdynamic headphones' headband padding is removable and could maybe fit over this to provide some additional support. I'd assume you could order this part from Beyerdynamic and use it on the Sony headphones, or perhaps there are other 3rd party solutions.","October 11, 2022"
Pierre B.,4,"This is a great pair of headphone and the noise canceling is really effective.
However, when I pair it with a MacBook Pro, there is intermittent crackling and stuttering.
It seems to come from Bluetooth interference, because my Bluetooth mouse also have issue during these episodic moments (non when I am not using the headphone). That really ruins the whole experience.","June 12, 2023"
Hello,4,"These are great headphones. I also own the previous model the XM3. This headphone is a step-up in quality of noise cancellation, sound. Not much else changed and I can't tell my XM3 from the XM4. The big upgrade here is the XM4 can connect to two bluetooth devices without having to disconnect the first one (as required by the XM3). Think about this feature before you buy because being able to pair the XM3 with one device at a time is a big pain, bigger than I thought before I bought them. Annoying is a better term. The XM4 fixed this issue and it works well.
The headphones have a mobile app that lets you customize them and it works well, but has features that can be quite annoying (I don't need it to determine my location to get ""optimal"" noise cancellation -- and the notification sound that starts when it ""notices"" you've changed locations -- like walking up the house stairs -- is truly annoying.
The BIG issue with this XM4 is that there is a bad sync issue with my LG TV. There is no current way to fix this. I've updated the firmware and no fix. About every 2-3 minutes there's a ""skip"" in the sound and then it's sync'd for a few moments and then goes back out of sync. Very annoying. So to fix it I use my Sony XM3 with my TV and the XM4 with my other devices. Sony needs to fix this immediately. The XM3 has no issues with my TV and never goes out of sync with the voices and sound.
If you don't have a TV and are using Bluetooth 5 devices, like a PC, the XM4's I have do NOT have the syncing problem on things other than my (2 years old) OLED TV.","January 1, 2021"
Saricx,4,"Comfy, feels very light on your head. Active noise canceling is phenomenal - with an extra setting to let ambient noise in.
It is controlled through a separate button on the headset - for turning ambient noise control on, turning off ANC entirely, and of course turning it back on.

Cups are comfortable. I havent had any issues with it being too warm.

Volume control is a pain. Keeping with the sleek aesthetic, it is controlled through touch controls on the right hand cup/headset. Swiping up for raising the volume, swiping down to lower it. It does not scroll through very quickly, you have to swipe up or down several times. If you swipe down, it *will* pause playback. This is quite obnoxious.

Be aware: if you lack bluetooth, or if your card/adapter is weak, or blocked by something, you WILL need a dongle. These are cheap online - but check *before* you buy so you can actually use the headset.

Switching from PC/laptop to mobile is rather seamless. It is controlled through an app on mobile - i would highly recommend downloading it regardless if you'll use it or not because this is how firmware updates get pushed out. There is an initial, rather long pack of firmware updates that need downloaded out of the box. This will take a few minutes - but dont fret, the headset comes fully charged out of the box.

It comes with an adapter for plane rides, a cable to plug into a headphone jack. And a...very short charging cable. It uses USB-C type, so if a short cord bothers you, purchase one or use one that you already have.

Final thoughts: The headset is pricy - but (nearly) everything about it is quality. The ANC is amazing, the sound quality is superb, but the volume control, and length of the charging cable, can be lacking for some. I would still highly recommend.","December 1, 2020"
dodg1677,4,"I got these to use with my Apple TV and iPhone at home. I found these to be incredibly frustrating in a few ways.
I'd be listening to youtube music on my Apple TV but the headphones would repeatedly disconnect and reconnect to my iPhone, each time causing an interruption to the music. When I unpaired from the iPhone I found I could not keep the auto interruption for if I spoke (or coughed sometimes). I reconnected to my iPhone and in the app turned off everything I could but it kept resetting these things. The only way I could find was to use it wired. But I already. have good wired headphones...I got these for wireless convenience and the noise reduction. And ambient mode (transparency on iOS) isn't nearly as good as my iPod Pro. But I do like the sound. So I brought them to work where most of my listening is on a Mac laptop. I have an add in for the sound called SoundSource. (All you Mac people should check this app out. It allows you to route the sound from whatever app you're using to wherever you want quickly and easily.). I found that this allows you to allow these phones to get louder than they normally would on this computer and...I can apply EQ and effects too if you want. And since I actually want and need to interrupt the sound when need to speak or reply to someone at work that problem is a plus instead of a hassle as it was at home.
I was also very happy when out walking far away from any other devices to interrupt my listening on my iPhone. I hope this helps someone else that may have similar problems to decide to keep them or not.","March 3, 2021"
Jen615,4,"I've owned every iteration of Sony's WH-1000 line, and this is the first time I've ever been disappointed. Since the XM2s, the sound quality has improved at the expense of build quality; first they switched to all plastic and then to a lighter, less resilient plastic. For the XM3s this was a fair tradeoff, the sound was immersive and the plastic afforded a more comfortable fit at the cost of durability. These are a different story. The headphones feel lighter for sure, but the plastic is noticably cheaper and more pliable. This in addition to the increase in ear padding led to a really compressed and uncomfortable fit for me. It made the soundscape a lot closer, the bass boomier, and after only about an hour of wear I'd have to take them off for a second every few minutes because they were making my ears sweaty (which hasn't happened to me with any other over ear headphones). I will say the noise cancelling is better than ever, but feeling like I'm in a tiny, boomy, sweaty little vacuum isn't what I was going for hahaha. I don't really have a need for multipoint connecting, but if i did then the issues might be worth it because at the end of the day these are still premium headphones, i just strongly prefer the previous model. I'm returning these and getting another pair of XM3s (i gave my last pair to a friend) but I'm still looking forward to the 5s.

Side Note: for all the previous models the lighter color was either gold or champagne tinted, and pictures make these look like they're that color too. They're not, they're a dull white-grey (think white leather). They scuff really easily, and will probably clash hard with most outfits. If you do like that color, the scuffs come off with some soap and water. Cheers!","February 14, 2021"
Nemo,4,"I was trying to find a more comfortable headphone than my Sony WH-1000XM2 and was looking at Bose QC 35 II and recently released Sony XM4. Below are the pros and cons of each,

XM2:
Pros - Great bass with the best low end rumble, accurate sound/timbre especially in percussion instruments, ~25hr battery life, excellent noise cancellation, no wear in pads after two years of usage
Cons - Fatigue after 4-5 hrs, gets a bit too warm, a tad heavy, pads have become a bit slim

XM4:
Pros - Better sound stage than XM2, a tad lighter, doesn't get as warm and more comfortable than XM2, 25+ hr battery life
Cons - Low end bass/rumble not as good as XM2, ear cups seem a bit smaller and likely impacting the bass performance, headband shorter and less adjustable than XM2

QC 35 II:
Pros - Best comfort, best in class sound stage/instrument separation
Cons - Sound accuracy/timbre of instruments not as good as the Sony's, especially noticeable in percussion instruments like Tabla and even Guitar sounded a bit off, Bose seems to process sounds and tend to highlight vocals and they don't sound as natural, ear pads lifetime not great and start to fall apart in 1-2 years of 5 days/week usage

I ended up returning the QC 35 II as the sound reproduction was not accurate and also the XM4 as it was not that big an upgrade in terms of comfort or sound, especially since it lacked the low end rumble of XM2. Just ended up bying a new set of ear pads for the XM2 and planning to hold out for another year or two for now.

UPDATE: I bought these ear pads from Geekia https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G7TJS5L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 for replacing the original ear pads for my XM2 and they are working great the past 5 months, they don't get as warm as the originals and the comfort is on par.","November 22, 2020"
Joel,4,"In general, this product is fantastic in just about every way. Their app has an EQ that can allow you to hear everything you want the way you want. Sound quality as a whole is everything you can expect when paying a premium price like this. By no means are these headphones cheap, but you do get what you pay for. Bass is deep and even rumbles if you EQ it like that. Vocals are clear and crispy. Highs never pink. I listen to just about all genres of EDM and these headphones are capable of handling any song that I play; I truly believe these headphones allow you to hear music the way artists intended their listeners to. As far as noise-cancelling goes, the difference is night and day with it on and off. Simply, definitely industry leading (as of late 2020) and makes a world of difference in my listening experience. My only issue with these headphones are the controls; I'm aware that's where most people's complaints are, and that's because it's the only problem I have encountered with these. The onboard controls in general are fine, but the pause/play command is super hard to hit. It may just be me, but in the end it's still difficult to do, but I'm sure eventually I'll get the hang of it. Additionally, the over ear for ambient sound control is hit or miss, sometimes it works, other times it requires another try. No real problems here though, I can always just use my phone to pause the music and just lift an ear cup off to hear someone, so I do not need these extra features on this headphone set, but it's always nice when it works. Overall, I cannot recommend these headphones enough to anyone, but because they are pretty expensive, I'd say wait for a sale and then snag them, I can assure you it will be worth the wait!","October 25, 2020"
Lanse NItahara,4,"These headphones are a lot lighter than I expected them to be. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Noise Cancellation is pretty good too. I was sitting by the plane engine and it completely cut out the humming noise. I used to wear a lot of earbuds so personally, wearing headphones make music sound a little muffled. I had to change the EQ a little to make it sound a little more clearer.

Overall, a very good headphone for a slightly expensive price. My only fear is breaking it due to its fragile feel.","March 10, 2023"
David Diskin,3,"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.

I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.

CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.

APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.

PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)

SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.

RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.

BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.

CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.

CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.

Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.

I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.","August 31, 2022"
Michael J. Mullen,3,"As a huge fan of the XM2s (which my son uses daily), I bought the XM4s as I needed to switch bluetooth connections and improved microphones for conference calls. Overall, I do love the XM4s. They have great sound and while I also have AirPod Pros, the sounds that the XM4s produce sounds richer and warmer.

The mics, while better, didn't improve conference calls but with an external after-market wired mic that fits the headphones, an inexpensive upgrade that I can manage.

But as others have indicated, they develop what is an insanely loud screeching noise that sounds like the mic gain is too high and the noise is a type of feedback in the right ear. Loud enough that others across the room and in an adjacent room can hear it.

I figured out that if I move the app over to another ANC mode, the screech ends immediately. So, I suspect that there could be a software or firmware patch to fix it.

Given that these were an investment for me, I looked on Reddit and other places to see if I could fix. I'd cleaned the mic after disassembling the right headphone and used compressed air to see if that would return them to their former glory days. Neither attempt worked. I still use them daily but have to get into the app when I boot them up to switch the ANC over to another option. Otherwise, the screeching starts.

Since these are out of warranty, there's unlikely to be a fix. While the XM5s are tempting, my faith in the XM line is a bit shaken.","November 27, 2023"
Jake,3,"I love the headphones. Super lightweight, very comfortable (even though u do build warm moisture in the earcups), and they sound pretty good for their target audience. The app is pretty good too, it's easy to use and simple. Not too complex. However, it is lacking some clarity I'd like. Overall a great headphone. My issue with it is a personal one. That being, when I wear headphones I get tension headaches from the pressure of the headphones pressing around my ears. I thought perhaps since I've tried these before and they were super light, they might be the answer, but unfortunately they ended up doing the same thing for me. So I guess headphones are just a no-go for me at all. Sticking to wireless earbuds and IEMs I suppose! Oh yeah and the noise cancellation is exceptional. It's absolutely EXCELLENT! You won't hear the plane at all. However, I did experience discomfort from the negative pressure. Beware!

If you like warm bassy sound that's pretty enjoyable for music then these are the headphones for you!! Haha, loved the sound, it was different from what I was used to for sure. And them being a headphone really immersed me into the experience. Oh well! I hope these work for everyone else who tries them out. I think I'm gonna return them, even though I got them for the sweet sweet deal of $229 😭 what a tragedy to have to return.","November 28, 2023"
Chrysanthemum Hyphus,3,"These headphones felt comfortable and had good build quality, and the sound was excellent. The voice pass-through was very effective, eliminating background noise. The app was also of high quality.

My problem with them is that there was no way to manually turn on and off the voice pass-through to the app. I bought them mainly for use in waiting rooms for my many medical appointments. The problem is that I wanted to enable the voice pass-through based on visual cues, primarily when someone enters the room to call names. I did not want to have to listen to people talking in the room, or a TV, or a conversation between patients and staff at the check-in/check-out window, but I wanted to be able to hear if it was my name being called or not. As I would not be the first person speaking, conversation mode, which enables pass-through when one begins speaking, is not useful. Neither is the capability for the headphones to learn based on location whether to enable voice pass-through. It was not even clear if I could program the button on the headphones to serve this purpose, but even if I could, if I’ve raised my hand to the headphones, it is just as easy to just take the headphones off as it is to try to hit that small button. It does not help in a restaurant or office either if I’m being approached by someone I want to hear who starts speaking before I do.

So I returned them, and this is another issue. Unlike most Amazon returns, I had to supply a box, and the shipping method they supply is very slow. Apparently I have to wait several weeks after sending out the return to get the refund to my payment method.","September 25, 2023"
William,3,"These are good headphones for sure, but are they worth the $300+ dollar amount? Short answer.... No.

If they were $200 and I'd say yeah, probably. It's a Sony product so they're also asking extra just for the brand name.

Pro's:
- Great sound, Good battery life, Noise canceling is really good, has Bluetooth AND an Auxiliary input jack for optional wired connection, has built in Microphone, can control media with your finger by swiping the earphone forward/backward and volume up/down and play/pause by double tapping, audio will automatically pause if you take off the headphones, and it comes with a very nice hard case for safe traveling.

Con's:
- It's almost entirely made of plastic. Plastic can get brittle and break, which is always a worry of mine. The headset will sometimes turn itself off when you're right in the middle of listening to something on a full battery (doesn't happen often but I've still noticed it), you CANNOT use the headphones while they're charging (if you try to charge them while you're listening to something the headphones will automatically turn off and go into charging mode).

- And the WORST thing about the headphones are the Earpads. The Earpads are not firm at all and they're very flat. Your ears will rub against the inside of the headphones (and the inside of the headphones are very hard). If you wear the headphones for 30 minutes to an hour... your ears will start to hurt (I have smallish ears and it still hurts). I've had these headphones for almost a year and I really regret not buying Thick replacement Earpads sooner. Now that I have thick Earpads, I can wear my headphones all day without my ears hurting. For headphones to cost over $300 you would think the Earpads would be good quality, but they're very cheap. So, if you plan on buying this headset, get the Thick replacement Earpads or else your ears will be miserably uncomfortable.

Summary:
If you plan on getting these fairly expensive headphones..... Make sure to buy Thick Replacement Earpads. Because the stock Earpads are flat as a pancake and your ears will hurt.

Note:
- The Earpads in the image that I uploaded are the thicker replacement Earpads. 👌","August 7, 2023"
Jeff,3,"I've owned a lot of headphones over the years; most of them wired, without any noise cancellation. I think ANC is a great innovation, though, and my first pair of noise canceling headphones were the Sony MDR10RNC's back in 2015. These didn't sound all that great, but I only bought them for use on airplanes, and they looked and felt really nice. That combined with the noise canceling made up for the lack of sound quality. I actually loved these headphones for what they were, which was a way for me to feel less fatigued after a very long flight, while also allowing me to enjoy the on-board IFE.

Fast forward to today, and I've just spent $350 on a new pair of Sony wireless noise canceling headphones. With five more years of R&D under Sony's belt, a much higher price tag than I paid for my MDR10's (they were about $140) and great reviews around the net, I had high expectations. For this kind of money, I expected not just a set of cans I could use on a plane but some everyday hi-fi headphones for music too. Unfortunately, they just don't sound very good, even with noise canceling off. I've tried them wired, wireless, on and off (you can use them turned off when wired), with noise canceling on and off, and using both AAC and LDAC codecs. The problem seems to be the headphone drivers, which is fundamental to the hardware.

I probably should have known better. These are mass market headphones, and even at fairly high prices like this, people today don't seem to be looking for accurate sound reproduction; they're looking for a lot of bass. These have that; I wish I'd seen this before buying but headphones.com (no affiliation!) tested their frequency response and found a ""v-shaped"" curve that emphasizes bass and to a certain extent treble. Unfortunately, the mid-range is where most of the music is, so really good-sounding mid-range and flat frequency response is the sign of a good headphone. These do have a cell phone app where you can set a custom EQ, and I did that. Unfortunately, the mid-range reproduction in these headphones just isn't very good - it sounds tinny and harsh, so the flatter you make the frequency response, the worse it sounds. These just aren't very good headphones in terms of sound quality, and I expected a lot better for $350.

In fact, I also own a pair of Cowin E7 Pro's, which are $60 Chinese wireless ANC headphones, and they sound almost as good as these. I had bought those literally the day before a flight because I found out I wasn't going to be able to plug in my headphones to an IFE system, and they were cheap enough to be an impulse buy. But they're totally fine for that price; they don't sound great but they're not absolutely awful either, they also have a ton of bass and their noise cancellation is adequate. For almost six times the price, I would expect these Sonys to sound a lot better, and they just don't. I was trying to upgrade and I'm not sure I really have.

As for the active noise canceling itself, yes, it's pretty good. My MDR10's noise canceling was pretty good too, five years ago. So are the Cowin's. Maybe I'm just more picky in terms of sound quality than noise canceling, but I feel like every ANC headphone cancels noise pretty well, though not perfectly - these are still tuned mostly for jet engines, and you're still going to hear stuff in higher registers. The WH-1000XM4's do have a slight hiss in ANC mode that means you probably won't want to use ANC at home. I noticed this right away and tested my other headphones to see if they did the same thing, since I hadn't noticed it before. And they do, but the frequency of the hiss on the 1000XM4's is a bit higher. It's not louder, just higher, so that's probably why I immediately noticed it.

Lastly, I am not a fan of the build quality of these, especially compared to my MDR10's - which, again, are also Sony ANC headphones and were much cheaper. The MDR10's look and feel premium, even today. The 1000XM4's look and feel like cheap headphones. They're all black plastic and just don't have the premium look or feel that I'd expect from a $350 set of headphones. They also seem to have a higher clamping force that makes them a little uncomfortable after an hour or two of listening. It's not noticeable at first but becomes noticeable pretty quickly.

If these cost $150, I'd say they were worth it. I do not think they are for $350.

I am seriously considering returning mine.","October 9, 2020"
Alko,3,"...but I didn't. I have the previous model WH-1000XM3’s and I compared these side by side. For weeks I went back and forth with fit, sound, and some of the features, but at the end of the day, the cons outweighed the pros for me. Bottom line up front…if you can get a hold of the XM3’s for the low, I suggest getting them over the XM4’s; but if you care to read my review, by all means!

First the fit--the headband and the ear cups seem to have a tad bit less material for the headphones to sit comfortably on my head. They felt loose, and I felt like I was constantly trying to find that sweet spot on my head. Now, I will say that I do not think this would be a problem for folks who have larger heads; however, I don't have a big head so I felt like with any slight movement the headphones would move out of place. As such, I was constantly adjusting the headphones. This is unlike the XM3’s which felt nice and snug on my head--they hugged my head.

Second, the sound--ABSOLUTELY amazing! These headphones sound great...BUT...they aren't as good as my XM3’s. They have a more neutral sound, with a slight loss in mids and highs as compared to the XM3's. I'm not a bass head, so I don't desire in your face (ear) bass. I like to listen for mids and highs, as well as instrument separation--basically how big is the soundstage?! I would constantly switch between the XM3’s and the XM4’s to compare the sound quality, and while there is slightly more bass with the XM4's, I would have to turn the headphones up more to hear all of the instrumentation. When I immediately switched to the XM3’s I would have to turn the volume down. Keep this in mind…I have the XM3’s so I have something to compare it to; If I didn’t, I would probably think the XM4’s sound absolutely amazing. But since I do, I still give the overall sound quality to the XM3’s.

Third, the features--first off, the noise cancellation is absolutely amazing! I don’t have anything else to compare it to, aside from the MX3’s, but just put it this way…I felt horrible when my 6 year old was calling for me for about 5 minutes at bedtime—yeah I thought he was asleep! Even within close distance I can’t hear people talking to me or noises until I activate the ambient sound our speak-to-chat enables. I wouldn’t say they’re a vast improvement over the MX3’s…as a matter of fact I want to say they perform slightly (and veery slightly at that) worse than the MX3’s. BUT…they’re still great! I would NOT let this sway you from getting the MX4’s.

I thought the new features were great at first. Aside from all the customizations, the main selling point for me was the multi(2)-device connection ability with the updated Bluetooth profile, as well as the speak-to-chat feature. I thought I would like the multi-device connection, however at the end of the day I mainly stuck to my phone. I actually had issues with toggling between my computer and my phone because I have studio monitors connected to my M-Audio Air controller to my computer. This required me to change the audio output preference on my computer in order to take advantage of the multipoint connection. Granted, this is just my setup. Others probably won’t have this issue. So, with that, the multi-device connection would be ideal for someone who will be listening to music on their laptop, and taking calls on their phone.

The speak-to-chat feature…this one is tough. While I love the fact that I can just start talking and it mutes my music/video as well as turn the ambient sound on immediately, I hated the fact that I if I coughed or made some other noise it would automatically trigger the mute and ambient sound. So, for those that love to sing or hum along with their tracks you’ll want to leave this feature off. Overall, I’m pretty sure most people will leave this feature off, so there’s really no point in having it. Once muted, the music/video does not resume, even after being silent for a period of time. You have to double tap the ear cup in order to restart the music/video.

While I know there are a lot more features for these headphones, I did not spend the time to really dive into the other features. The mentioned three points were the main things I was looking for in these headphones.

Opinions are subjective. You definitely need to consider your wants/needs from these headphones. That said…these are awesome headphones, but for me, the cons outweighed the pros.","July 16, 2021"
Blinky,3,"I’ve had the 1000XM2 since it was originally released many years ago. I decided I wanted to try out the new version 1000XM4 because it just has to sound better right? Well I got the new one and started playing a new Billie Eilish song with super good quality, and I could not distinguish the difference between the two headsets. The new V4 headsets look great and they have better buttons. But I was just shocked that the sound quality is almost in distinguishable. Maybe there’s some spatial audio difference, but I even tried that, and they all sounded great!
I’ve used my old headsets for noise cancellation on noisy trains & airplanes and they work very well. I didn’t get a chance to test the new ones but I can’t imagine there’s that much difference.
I would recommend if you’re looking for some super good headsets find a nice used or reconditioned 1000XM2 and save some money.","November 27, 2023"
VisibleKitten,3,"I've enjoyed these headphones for right at 2 years. After the first year I noticed the right side was squeaking just a little. Nothing crazy but annoying. I reached out to Sony, they pointed me to a 3rd party, 3rd party said $75 just for them to look at them so that's where that ended. The squeaking has now become unbearable. If I walk on a treadmill at a light pace it squeaks every time I step. Other reviews have said this but it's like the sound of plastic rubbing.

You may say to yourself well he didn't do anything to fix them. He is only complaining. You would be wrong. I took apart the entire left side and thoroughly cleaned it out. Every screw cleaned and replaced and any part that is supposed to move or where two pieces of plastic touch I scrubbed. Put back together and no changed whatsoever. I'm done with these headphones.","November 27, 2023"
Hasan Can,3,"For summary, I don’t think this device deserves $350. I am not angry with SONY but a bit unimpressed. MX4 is not far away from MX3. If you are an average consumer like me, an $130 AirPods or $150 another NC headphones will be a similar experience. I am still debating if I want to keep MX4 or return it. It’s just not good enough.

Well, here we go.

Since I was 5 I’ve had tons of Sony products. I remember trying to put a cassette into my father’s old Walkman with my tiny hands. Then when I was old enough to hold a controller we got a Sony PlayStation 1. It was amazing to play Crash Bandicoot, Tekken, Rayman and so much more! Then I had a Sony DVD player that I used for decades. There is a big SONY music player that my dad had from the ’80s and it still works well…

Why I opened this review with my past is because I’ve always had amazing experiences with Sony. Now when I watched some reviews on YouTube, MX4 looked really appealing with new NC technology, pairing with two devices, approximate sensor, enchanted touch sensor, thicker padding, etc.

But the reality is a bit different, which I’ll explain it furthermore.

I want to start with things that make me want to return the MX4:

1. Touch sensor is unreliable. When I want to quickly reduce the volume, it skips like 5 songs and I’m not even exaggerating. Volume control is off-grade.

2. In the Sony app, there is no option that says “turn off the NC”. Instead of that it says “Ambient Sound Control” ?? I’m not really a tech ignorant, but it was a bit weird for me to not being able to turn NC off/on easily.

3. When NC is on it produces white noise. Maybe it’s how it works on this new tech but I didn’t like it. I have SENNHEISER HD 4.5 NC headphones that I bought 2 years ago. When I turn on NC on those headphones I never hear any kind of noise.

4. Again with NC, with SENNHEISER it doesn’t give me dizziness, but somehow with SONY, NC makes me dizzy.

5. Turning on MX4 takes you 2 seconds, starting to listening music is like 10 seconds with connecting and starting to playing music, this may sound like a first world problem but why turning on a headphone is not just a click? Or even when you pick up your device from the case and put it on your head won’t make turn it on? Is it really a hard feature to put on headphones that costs $350?

6. I also use Apple AirPods on a daily basis, I paid $130. It’s lighter and more portable. Gives almost the same quality of sound. You can work-out with AirPods, they won’t slide off of your head. I found myself using them more than a new pair of MX4. I also consider the environment that I live is not being really loud, and I don’t fly often, so I believe cutting edge NC tech is not what I was looking for -I guess-. So paying new headphones $350 and not getting something new, disappointed me.

7. This is a SONY product right. You’d expect it to work with PlayStation 4, but guess what? No, it does not! PS says it doesn’t support MX4. Like a JOKE.

8. I know if SONY makes a product, it will stay for decades. But when you want to change the ear cups, you can’t. They are not changeable. Wow. So after you use your MX4 for couple years I guess you’ll just buy another MX5 because your ear cups wore off.

9. USB-C cable that comes with MX4 is REALLY short, it’s not a deal-breaker but c’mon, $350.

10. If I'm outside and I'm on the phone, It gives a bit of wind noise to the other party and the person on the other side says you sound like you are away from the mic. So the phone call quality is not really good. -for a device that you pay $350-

11. Hover your hand to talk or speak to stop the music is just useless features. If I wanna talk or hear my surroundings, I just take headphones off my head.

And of course, give the devil it’s due:

1. Pairing with 2 devices works well. I’ve tried it and it’s pretty handy.

2. Proximity sensor works most of the time. 4 out of 5 times.

3. Battery life is amazing. I don’t think there is much to say to that. Just so good.

4. Bluetooth works well too, I’ve never experienced any connectivity issues.

5. MX4’s case is sleek and has a charger brick designed for airplanes. That’s thought well.","August 30, 2020"
Gary,3,"I have been using these headphones for a while and love them for the most part. Great sound and great noise canceling. My only negative is I wanted to use them to make calls and game but whenever you use the mic it kills all sound quality for some reason. It becomes staticy and it seems to make it so you hear everything going on around you more killing all noise canceling. I have looked it up and it seems they are made to do this making these headphones useless for gaming over discord or using on an xbox or playstation. I had to buy a second mic and use that instead of the mic attached to the headphones. This feature makes me very weary on getting an upgraded version.

If you want these for music or watching stuff they are great!","December 8, 2023"
A. Frazer,3,"Here's my honest review. I apologize if it's going to be long, or if I offend your own opinions.

First, I'm not an audiophile. I usually listen to YouTube and Spotify on my Windows computer through a $50 pair of headphones. But I do know what excellent sound should sound like. My dad taught me that when I was young.

Second, I never thought I would ever spend $350 on a pair of headphones. But with COVID-19 forcing me to work from home, I just can't function with the noise from the neighbor's landscapers (two neighbors, two interruptions per week) and another neighbor's yard construction going on. I stumbled upon multiple reviewers practically wetting their pants over how fantastic the NR in these headphones was. And since I'm always getting the headphone cord tangled up in my chair, I though I would go for high-end Bluetooth headphones.

My review:

These headphones are very comfortable. I don't understand how anyone could wear them for eight hours, and they're not as easy to wear as my $50 Plantronics headsets. But they are very lightweight for cans. I can wear these for 1-2 hours.

I plugged them in with the uselessly short wire included in the box. That wasn't going to work. Then I added a 4"" extension cord. The sound, even through my Dell laptop or my HP tower was very good. They don't have the powerful bass that my $50 inside-the-ear-canal ear buds have. But for over-the-ear cans, they're pretty good.

Next, I tried the noise reduction. After reading some of the glowing reviews I expected I would hear nothing but my heart beating. Sorry to disappoint you. The NR is very good. The NR is much better than the $300 Bose 3 headphones I tried 15 years ago and immediately returned for a refund. It does completely block out my neighbor's landscapers (yeah!) and my neighbor's construction (workers). And they even block out the annoying hum from my overhead lights and the annoying noise from my laptop fan. That was a pleasant surprise. But the reason I bought them for to block out the landscapers, so I am keeping them. But do they match the glowing reviews I read before I ordered them? No. They do not block out people's voices, of the TV set downstairs. I was hoping to use these when flying, instead of my inside-ear-canal ear buds. No chance. If you don't like to listen to people on your airplane yapping, stick with inexpensive ear buds.

Last, I disconnected the wired connection and tried Bluetooth. It connected easily to my iPod, my Windows 10 PC, and my Windows 10 laptop. With Bluetooth, at best the sound quality is mediocre. It's about on-par with my $30 Plantronics headset when they are wired (although the Plantronics headset doesn't have NR). At worst, the sound with Bluetooth and Windows 10 is terrible. Sometimes it sounds like it coming through a flanger. The sound volume phases through either the volume swaying up and down, or the bass/treble is swaying up and down. I have not experienced this problem when connected through BT to my iPod. I saw on Reddit this is a known problem due to the limited CODEC's supported on Windows 10. The Reddit poster suggested plugging them back in through the wired connection. I did that, and they sound very good.

So, my conclusion:

For comfort I'd give them 8/10. For the price I expected them to be a bit more comfortable.

Noise reduction: If you're sitting at your desk they're excellent at blocking out office/house noises: 10/10. But if you're on an airplane and want to block out people yapping away, or if you want to block out your coworkers yapping in the office, you might be disappointed: 3/10.

Bluetooth connectivity. We expect it to be easy. That's the purpose of BT. 10/10

Bluetooth sound quality with Windows 10. This is where they disappoint. I give them 4/10. And don't throw away the 1/8"" plug that comes in the box. You will need it. You might not have this problem with an iPod, but there's no way I'm going to fiddle with a tiny iPod when I'm sitting at a desk.

Value for the money: 8/10. They are very good (with a wired connection). But they do not live up the glowing reviews I read on the internet (yeah, what was I thinking).

Shamus,3,"I managed to get a great deal on these headphones originally and at the time i thought they were a great pair of headphones. Unfortunately, after a about a year and a half of service they started to go down in hardware quality. One of the first things i noticed was a popping sound began to occur every once in a while i was using them. Eventually, i could not use the wireless feature anymore because a super high pitched noise would start blasting through my right earphone whenever it connected to Bluetooth. I had to resort to using it wired which worked out for a while until the headphones eventually in all started to glitch out. For the deal i got for them, i would PROBABLY recommend them and i may have just got unlucky on the pair i got.","October 29, 2023"
Fahmi,3,"I saw these headphones were very popular and highly recommended, but from my use, the ANC doesn’t cancel out much noise in public spaces like trains and cafes, and the transparency is honestly horrible, it feels very cheap quality. The sound quality comes very bassy and I had to tune the EQ to make it more comfortable. The touch controls on the side are very finicky, and sometimes too sensitive and can easily be touched and activated accidentally.
But I will say, the comfort level of these headphones are pretty good. For longer periods of times they’re pretty comfortable and that’s because they’re super lightweight and sometimes you can’t even tell they’re there. But overall for the amount you pay for them, I’d choose a different pair of headphones.","October 31, 2023"

Comfort:
I wear these for hours straight and haven't found them uncomfortable or heavy.

Generally it's fine, for the first couple of years I didn't have connection issues. Recently however, having owned them for 2 years now, it will constantly, and I mean constantly, drop the Bluetooth connection (makes a ""Bluetooth connection dropped"" sound) and then reconnects with a ""Bluetooth connected"" sound immediately after. This occurs if there is no sound actively playing; it's incredibly annoying. This only occurs with my computer but no other Bluetooth device (including headphones) has this problem.

Software Support:
Not terrible but not great. For some reason, the ""Headphone Connect"" app (which is used to more finely control and configure these headphones) is only available on your phone; there is no desktop version. Within the app you can change the equalization profile, change what the general purpose button does (Google Assistant or Noise Cancellation mode), and update the firmware (UI for doing this isn't straightforward and buggy).

Gesture Use:
Tends to be stable. Every now and then double tapping doesn't play/pause as it's supposed to but usually it works. Taking off/putting on the headphones correctly pauses/resumes music. Swiping the right cup correctly moves songs forwards/backwards and adjusts music. Holding my hand to the right cup lowers volumes and disables noise cancellation to hear the outside environment.

Music:
- I'm not an audiophile but the sound quality seems good to me. These get plenty loud if you like your music loud (as I do).
- The bass is good and very noticeable; it won't shake the headphones but you'll hear it and it feels balanced.
- The noise cancellation is pretty good. On a plane I'd say it gets rid of 60%-70% of the noise of the plane, and that's before actually playing music.
- Like most on-ear and over-the-ear headphones, these are basically speakers, not headphones. Unless you're in a loud place, everyone will easily hear your music, even with the volume fairly low. These shouldn't be used anywhere semi-quiet (such as an office) unless the volume is kept extremely low.

Mic/Calls

Sorry to say, but there's literally nothing good about these with calls and meetings.
- There's no dedicated ""Mute"" button on something that's intended to be used for calls and meetings. It is incredibly annoying to have to manually mute/unmute yourself in Teams instead of just pressing a button on the headphones. This is an oversight and can't even be fixed by assigning that functionality to the general purpose button.
- Randomly people tell me I sound far away or they can barely hear me; disconnecting and reconnecting may or may not solve the problem for them. This particular issue is usually problematic in phone calls (Phone, Messenger and WhatsApp) rather than meetings (Zoom and Teams).
- About 60% of the time people can't hear me at all, whether the device is connected to my computer or my phone. Like the bad quality issue, disconnect/reconnect doesn't usually fix it and I end up giving up and just using the device speakers.
- There's a bug in these where if I'm connected to two devices simultaneously and utilizing the call functionality on one of the devices, everything is fine for a few minutes and then voices in calls/meetings become evenly ""choppy""; there's a complete break in call sound every 1 second. So it sou...nds lik...e ho...w I'm typi...ng thi...s, and it does not stop until I disconnect the headphones from the other device. This reproduces almost 100% of the time.

So all in all, they're good headphones with various pitfalls but the major one is using these for calls and meetings. As long as you're using them just as headphones, they should be a good fit.","July 14, 2022"
Brian J Bolduc,3,"The sound quality is great, my complaint is with the software. There is a ""speak to chat"" option which lowers the volume on what you are listening to if you start speaking or make a sound. You can turn this feature off as many times as you like, it will turn itself back on. You can update the firmware on the headphones as many times as you like (several updates claim to fix this issue) but he ""speak to chat"" feature cannot be disabled. I will not be buying Sony headphones again. Sony has been ""trying"" to fix this issue for years and can't seem to figure it out.","November 7, 2023"
Isla 💋,3,"I wanted to love these headphones so badly. They are super comfortable and cute and the noise cancellation is really good.

However, the consistent connection issues drive me nuts. It’s a daily occasion trying to connect the bluetooth, having to turn the headphones on/off, forget device, reconnect etc. I mostly use the headphone with my work laptop, personal laptop and then occasionally my phone. Even though they are supposed to support multi-device bluetooth connection (which works sometimes) whenever switching between devices it’s a huge hassle. And not talking about being connected to device A and then switching to device B, but simply having used the headphones on device A one day, then next day turning them on an trying to connect to device B.

Too often my laptop shows them connected, the headphones announce “connected” and still nothing. I have noticed sometimes going in the settings and toggling between the output and input sound options - it will work when input is selected but the sound is kind of altered. As soon as closing settings the sound stops. So not sure what’s going on with that.","October 21, 2023"
Lori Pierce,3,"Honestly, I would not buy these if I knew then what I know now. They are good with blocking sound, but that is it. When I take these headphones off, they are supposed to stop what I am listening to. This never happens. I had better luck with my daughter’s beats than these more expensive sony’s. I have had these headphones for three months and I wish I had spent less money on different headphones. Just FYI","November 30, 2023"
GCB,3,"After reading several online articles on the best wireless ANC headphones in the $300-400 range, I chose three to try out:

- Sony WH-1000XM4
- Master & Dynamic MW65
- Bowers & Wilkins PX7

The Sony pair arrived first and my initial thought was that although they had plenty of cool bells & whistles (touch sensitive volume control, automatic pause when removing them from your head) and the ANC was very effective, they sounded surprisingly flat. Even after trying various EQ settings within the Sony app and on my iPhone, the sound was decent but just not good enough for a $350 pair of headphones. And the most important thing to me with headphones is sound quality. I couldn't help but wonder why these headphones had such great reviews on sound quality when to my ears they just sound dull. All bass and mid, very little clarity of treble. To me, it seems the majority of the money for this pair went into the fancy features and not to the sound quality.

Next came the Master & Dynamic MW65 -- a newer company based out of NYC I hadn't heard of until this week. Besides the absolutely stunning design (not the most important thing to me honestly) I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the full, rich sound and crystal clear quality of the audio -- especially on the high end. An absolutely beautiful, well balanced, natural sound -- unlike the Sony's. Bass and midrange are important of course, and these have plenty of low end punch, but if you're like me and you want a precise, clear, open treble (so you can really hear all those delicate cymbals and high hats), then these will delight you. To be fair, they do not have many of the fancy features of other headphones in this price range (and they don't come with an app, which is fine by me), and the ANC isn't quite as effective as the Sony's. But a more subtle ANC is also what keeps the music sounding so great. They're also the only pair of the three that didn't come with a hard case (the case is soft), so to protect these I'm going to spend another $25 on a case. They're worth it. I only wish these were super soft over-ear phones instead of on-ear phones. The earpad leather is very soft and they are definitely comfortable (even to a man with big ears like mine), but I feel after hours of usage an over-ear set would be more comfortable.

Finally the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 arrived. I had high hopes for these because of their reviews, and the reputation of B&W for many years running. So I was as surprised as I could possibly be when I put them on and they sounded as flat and dull as the Sony's. In fact, after an A-B comparison they sounded nearly identical to the Sony's. Plus, the B&W app was buggy and terrible, and didn't even include EQ. (I used the iPhone settings to adjust EQ instead, but it still didn't help the B&Ws much.)

Master & Dynamic was the clear winner of the three, no contest. It amazes me that the Sony and B&W headphones have plenty of glowing reviews from people who rave about the sound quality. All I can think of is everyone's preferences are different, but most likely the people who popped them on and enjoyed them didn't actually do A-B comparisons with other brands. It was when I compared the Master & Dynamics with the others that I really noticed what the other two pair were missing.","November 13, 2020"
SB,3,"I think it’s overhyped but in reality it’s just an okay headphone in 2023-24… There are much better headphones out there !

I did not found these comfortable to wear for more than an hour or two plus noise cancellation is not impressive! I am returning for refund.","November 27, 2023"
Evan Lloyd,3,"I did lots of research before purchasing over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. The XM4s landed at the top of my list after weighing pros and cons of about 4-5 other models (including AirPods Max and even the XM5s). I’m happy with these, but they aren’t perfect.

The battery life is incredible. Period.

The noise cancelling in controlled environments is excellent. However, the noise cancelling when in an environment that does not have consistent noise (such as on an outdoor walk in the city) falls off significantly. The wind noise and “random” noises (such as a truck accelerating) are still annoyingly audible.

Also, maybe I just have a huge head (I don’t think I do) but I wish the ear cups were just even 10% larger. My ears tend to feel the slightest bit cramped while wearing these. An hour is the absolute maximum I can wear these at a time before needing a break.

I think I’m to the point where I am spoiled by Apple aesthetics and the overall experience with Apple products. (I recognize it’s not a true apples-to-apples comparison between my AirPods Pro and the XM4s, but I’m not willing to spend $600 on the over-the-ear AirPods Max. I’m speaking more about the overall user experience.) For example:
The app that’s needed to set up the XM4s is fine, but just unintuitive enough to be annoying.
The XM4s’ noise cancelling gives me a bit of the “claustrophobic” sensation that I never get from the AirPods Pro.
Even though you CAN make phone calls on the XM4s, the microphone quality isn’t good enough to do so In any situation where you need to be clearly understood.

I guess at the end of the day, if my AirPods Pro and XM4s are both sitting in front of me, I’m choosing my AirPods Pro 99 times out of 100. The only time I found the XM4s superior was on an airplane, and even then, it’s close.

I still do recommend these to anyone looking for over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. I’m only saying to take what the YouTube Tech Review machine is saying about these with a grain of salt.

They’re fine. Not great.","February 25, 2023"
Topher,3,"I've been in love with my XM2's for the past few years and have been wearing them all day, every day since the beginning of the pandemic. I recently realized if they were to give out unexpectedly, I'm up a creek until I can replace them. So I ordered these XM4's after reading the list of improvements and was quite excited to use them. However, nearly every improved feature is flawed to the point that the overall experience is very much diminished.

Improvement #1: Headband. The padding is definitely thicker, however the foam is harder and creates a pressure point on top of my head which I never experienced with the XM2's. Also, the slightly higher positioning changes the balance causing it to shift more when moving my head.

Improvement #2: Multi Device pairing. This was one of the main features I wanted, however I've had to disable it as it continually causes ""Device #2"" (computer) to be muted if I'm using an app on ""Device #1"" (phone), even if that app is making no sound whatsoever.

Improvement #3: Noise canceling. Not at all improved. In Full Noise Canceling Mode, it sounds similar to the XM2's in Ambient Sound Mode. There is noticeable hiss and if you have a fan on, you can still hear it. A barking dog across the street sounded like it was in the next room.

Improvement #4: Pause when removing headphones. This is great in concept, but terribly executed; another feature I've had to disable. It's just a light sensor inside one of the ear cups, so if you're in a dark room it has no effect. If you are in a light room and take them off, the media will pause, but turn off the lights on your way out and it will unpause again. If the media is already paused when you take them off, it will unpause. A frustrating experience.

Improvement #5: Sound quality. This is not improved. In fact it sounds like in order to address the issue many people reported with the sound being ""bass-y"" they added some high end that makes the sound tinny. I did notice the sound was a bit bass-heavy at first on the XM2's, especially in comparison to the Bose QC2's I had been using for over a decade before that, but I like a lot of bass, so I always saw that as a positive. The XM2's have always had a crisp, clear and pleasant sound for me. I heard things I never had before in music I'd been listening to for decades. The XM4's don't sound any better than the Bose.

Improvement #6: Speak to chat. The third new feature that I've had to disable. Every time you start to sing along to the music it pauses. It's probably a very useful feature in certain circumstances, but not in any I'm currently in.

The reduction in battery life over the XM2's is noticeable and they don't quite last me two days of use whereas I never had to worry about running out of juice before. I will say that I do prefer getting an estimated percentage of battery as opposed to the High, Medium, Low of the prior model.

While writing this review I've been wearing the XM2s after having worn the XM4's for the previous 11 hours and the XM2's are so much more comfortable and peaceful. I'm very disappointed and I know that the next incarnations will likely stray further and further in the wrong direction so I will probably never buy another pair of Sonys again.","June 11, 2021"
Samuel Gamboa,3,Sound quality is great. Battery lifetime is not bad. I constantly have connectivity issues with windows 11 to the point that I prefer to use the wired mode when using the PC. I have no issues when I paired them with my android.,"November 19, 2023"
never again shop retail,3,Great sound on phone. Not so much on TV. I have a galaxy phone and Samsung TV. Had such a hard time setting it up every time. Also it uses phone app to connect to 2nd devise. The Instrution says it's built for Apple product even though it has a small Droid icon on the box and app down load from Google store. Few times when I tried to connect to my new smart TV. It buzzed. Way to combursome to use. Got a bose to replace this one. Those don't need a app to connect to devises. Having said that it did have great sound on my galaxy phone. Ya returning this one. It might work better on Apple devises. 🍎,"October 12, 2023"
Brian Mayer,3,"My headline says it all. I had the predecessor WH1000XM3 headphones for about 3 years and never had a single issue with them. All of the issues I'm currently experiencing are only with this 'upgraded' model.

1. These are good for AUDIO ONLY (e.g. listening but not watching anything) - and the audio sounds exceptional - this is important to note.

2. The noise cancelling compared to the previous generation product is atrocious. I am sitting here listening to music in my XM4's while writing this review while house cleaners are upstairs vacuuming and I can hear the vacuums like they are right here next to me. It's completely distracting. By comparison, I used to be able to put on some music in the XM3's while sitting in a room with people talking and watching TV - and I'd still be able to fall asleep because EVERYTHING was so muted. Now with the XM4's, ambient noise is subdued but I can hear EVERYTHING. Changing noise canceling modes does nothing, it just works poorly, period.

3. I used to have my XM3's connected to my LG TV via Bluetooth to watch movies and videos or play games. I never once had any issues or concerns and I used them for hours and hours and hours and hours. The XM4's CONSISTENTLY lose sync with the video after a few minutes and I have to restart the stream, EVERY TIME, to resync which only works for a few minutes before falling out of sync again. Seems there's perhaps some Bluetooth incompatibility or other issue at large, however Sony Support just tells me my TV might not support the proper Bluetooth standard as a complete guess. I asked if they can just exchange these for my old WH1000XM3s and was told they won't take back or exchange my headphones for the old model.

I'm basically out $350 for a product that should have cost $75 max. Sony has made it clear to me that they don't care about customer satisfaction, especially with releasing a product that has lost some key features - features which I absolutely need for a $350 price tag and the loss of said features means this product can no longer set itself apart from competing products. I'll be moving on to the Bose QC headphones moving forward and avoiding Sony products going forward.

Thank you, Sony - because of your lack of concern for releasing quality products and driving customer satisfaction, you've just lost another customer.","October 13, 2022"
OK,3,"4 MONTH UPDATE:
I need to elaborate on the MUTE issue, no mute function on a Bluetooth headset is a huge oversight.
Now that an update hasn't even been pushed to correct this problem, down to 3 stars.
The worst part is the music pausing at the slightest sound like, a cough, a hard exhale at the gym, a glass making contact with the table...

No mute: minus one star.
Such a glaring oversight, but typical of Sony to ALMOST make a great product.

As a gamer, I have owned several Sony headsets. They always sound great, but will fail structurally, if one is not careful.
Wipe down the pleather and, I go so far as to put on and remove this set with both hands.
App is basic; works.
Pairing is simple.
Hold to power off and keep holding.

I am not disappointed but the missing mute feature killed the business the PS5 applications.
Great for music and movies/TV, of course

IDK how anyone wears these to workout. So bulky and they make my head even hotter. And, again, oils from hair and skill will eat the pleather. Wipe it down. Headpiece, too.
As a musician, I will update after I lay several tracks with these cans.","July 19, 2023"
Kevin Grant,3,"Ended up returning these for the simple fact that having two devices paired with the headphones was a pain to use. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great but expect issues if you want to use the multi device support with Apple products. The feature does not change audio playback seamlessly at all. You have to always disconnect the Bluetooth connection from your MacBook if you want to listen on your iPhone. It even says in my spotify app that’s it’s connected to the xm4 but it has audio playback. Here are the specific issues I found. This is with the “connect to 2 devices simultaneously” feature in the Sony connect app switched on.

Issue #1: when I turn the headphones on to start my day, they connect to both my iphone and Mac laptop, cool but If I choose to start playing music from spotify on my iPhone, I hear no audio playback in the headphones even though it says they’re connected in the spotify app. I see in the Sony connect app it is defaulting to my laptop even though there is no audio playback coming from the laptop and the spotify desktop app isn’t even open on my laptop. I can’t switch it to play from my iPhone in the Sony app either.

Issue #2: As a result of issue #1, you then have to always disconnect the headphones from my laptop Bluetooth in order to start listening to music from the spotify app on my iPhone. Not seamless.

Issue #3: if I am connected to both my iPhone and laptop simultaneously and listening to music through the iphone, when I take my headphones off for a few seconds it pauses playback (expected) but when I put them back on they won’t start playing audio again for the iPhone. I look in the Sony connect app and it has switched the device connection to my laptop even though nothing is playing from the laptop. When I start playing from my spotify app again, the same thing from issue #1 happens, audio doesn’t start playing again from the iPhone. The connection just stays on the laptop in the Sony app. You can’t even switch the connection in the Sony connect app.

Issue #4: A similar issue happens if you are in a zoom call on your laptop and pick your headphones up to readjust and put them back on. They will disconnect from your laptop and switch to your iPhone in the middle of a call if you have the multi device feature turned on. Super annoying. The speak to chat feature also has issues if you have that on during a zoom call.

It seems like the main issue is the headphones Bluetooth connection defaults/favors the laptop Bluetooth connection for whatever reason. It is not seamlessly switching between the two depending on the audio playback which I thought was the multi device support feature.

It seems like my only real solution is to not use the iPhone spotify app when I am on my laptop. Just use the spotify Mac desktop app. I thought with having the Bluetooth multi device support, issues like this would not happen and I could seamlessly listen to music from my iphone and then jump on a zoom call from my laptop without having to fiddle with Bluetooth connections and visa versa. These issues were enough for me to return and get the current $150 cheaper Bose QC35ii.","November 1, 2020"
Alex,3,"So the sound is good on these. Some people said better than Bose, but I disagree, I think I prefer Bose better. I got it on sale on Amazon so the price was exceptional.

Downside it requires an app to play on devices. It's not just a simple blue tooth sync with any device. Like ariplanes you will need to plug in because you can't connect without the app installed if using entertainment device from the plane.","October 21, 2023"
Amazon Customer,3,"I'm not sure if mine are defective, but they sound good in quiet places, but it's not enough at the gym where it is noisy. It also makes crackling noise at times. Finally, the range or connection, at least in mind, kept trying to cut off or pausing. I will return these, I need more music at the gym. I like getting lost in it.","October 25, 2023"
cryomerlin,3,"I already had a pair of Sony noise cancelling headphones, the WH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset I got from Costco. But I heard such great things about the XM4's that I just had to get a pair. So when they went on sale I jumped on it. Now I LOVE the WH-H910N headphones. Really couldn't imagine anything sounded better, but I was persuaded by the youtube reviewers that the XM4 was a huge leap forward, and the XM4 had bluetooth 5.0 (just like my WH-H910N's) with the extended range to 100 feet or so, which is why I never wanted the XM3's, as they only had the 30 foot range of bluetooth 4. So anyways, I ordered em, I got em, I unpacked em, I put em on, and powered on. HISSSSSSSSSSSSSS. That's what I heard. Opened the sony headphones app and checked to see ANC was on. It was. Downloaded a firmware update from Sony. Thought that might help. HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. No help. Looked it up online and this apparently is a common issue with these headphones. When I played music the sound quality was excellent, with perhaps a larger ""space"" sound than my h.ear on 3's, but not really a better sound. And you have to turn up the volume to a certain point to cancel out the hissing, which is still audible at low music volumes. I tried moving the ambient noise meter in the app, but that just let in more ambient noise. So.........just disappointing. I know Sony can do ANC well because I have a set with flawless ANC execution, but the XM4's are just a mess. I read Sony replaced Qualcomm chips in the XM3's with Mediatek chips in the XM4's and ditched support for some codecs (apx?), but not sure how that would make ANC hiss.

By way of comparison, My WH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset is dead silent with ANC on. DEAD SILENT. I hear nothing. No hiss. No white noise. Nothing. Freaking awesome. So when you buy a pair of headphones that is allegedly the apex predator of ANC headphones, the best of the best, you expect them to at least match the performance of the headphones you got for a hundred bucks at Costco. These XM4's, however, were not as good as the h.ear on 3's I already owned. So I returned em. Maybe I could have exchanged them for a different pair, and the new pair wouldn't have the hissing sound, but I doubt it. I read so many reviews of this product where people would say they enjoyed the ANC's ""white noise"" and found it relaxing. I found it irritating. No way I could listen to that. It's not noise cancellation if it just replaces the ambient noise with a different noise. Maybe the XM5's will address the hissing issue, but I'm happy with the wH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset I have. You may want to consider those.","November 4, 2021"
Landon,3,"THE GOOD:
I was honestly impressed with the noise cancellation. I have neighbors that are quite loud, and I have a window AC unit so I could hear them and all their outdoor chores like mowing, but with these on it's almost completely silent, and unnoticeable if I had any audio playing whatsoever. Even shrill noises like the train horns passing by are much quieter. I thought the touch controls were nice, albeit sometimes a little inconsistent, but not often. The App was ""meh"" to me, I guess it did it's job?

Sound is decent, you mainly buy something like this to block out the surrounding noise around you instead of audiophile reasons, but it gets the job done so you can zone out or focus.

THE BAD:
Unfortunately after about a day or two the right ear kept producing a buzzing sound that would get louder over time as you wear them. This seems to possibly be caused by ""moisture buildup"" (aka sweating, from what I've seen people say anyway) and usually seems to only happen to one side, left or right. I saw some advice online about fiddling with the wires to fix this, but you really shouldn't have to do that on a pair of headphones that costs over 300 dollars. There seems to be some quality assurance issues in the manufacturing process, because it never happened on the left side for me, and again, I see people only reporting this happening on one side most of the time. Some people would recommend wiping them out with a dry cloth, but I found that barely helps and is only temporary. My room is constantly cooled too, so it's not like I'm sweating all the time. Some people report this never happening, others report it happening to their units after several months, really seems like you're playing some lottery where your prize is a dysfunctional unit. The noise WILL drive you absolutely insane, which is why I returned them, even though the noise cancelling is so good.

Also, the leather (don't know if real or not) earpads probably contribute a bit to that sweat/moisture issue. The headband is also made out of that material, and a bit thin, which I find gets uncomfortable after some time due to the lower surface area resting on your head. The Sennheiser 569's use something that feels reminiscent of suede for the earpads and headband, but doesn't make me sweat, and in my opinion is just as good of ""passive"" noise cancellation since it's also a closed back design.

With all that said, if Sony happens to ever fix these issues in possible future iterations of these headphones, mainly the buzzing + comfort, I would be more than happy to pick up a pair. It was hard for me to return them just from the ANC alone, but the buzzing was making me go crazy.","September 30, 2021"
Andy,3,"This is a very disappointing review for me to write. I had the Sony XM3 headphones and got thousands of hours of use out of them during the pandemic. About a year after having them, I started having issues with the active noise cancellation (there was a slight background buzzing sound), so I turned the ANC off. The sound isolation was good enough that I didn't mind using them that way, and continued to use them until the band cracked. Despite the ANC issues, I liked the comfort and features of the heaphones, so I replaced them with the XM4's.

Now, a little over a year later, the ANC is having issues again. This time, however, it's not just mildly annoying. There's a feedback loop being caused somehow so that the headphones blast an ear-piercing high-pitched tone inside the earcups. It's certainly loud enough to be extremely uncomfortable, and probably loud enough to do lasting damage if you don't get the headphones away from your ears quickly enough. So again I can't use the ANC, and I have to be careful during the few seconds after I turn the headphones on while they pair with my devices, before I can turn the ANC safely off.

I contacted Sony support and they've told me they can't help because I'm 1.5 months beyond the abyssmal 1-year warranty period. I'll have to pay to ship the headphones to a repair center, then pay whatever they decide to charge for the repair. After some Googling, it seems this high-pitched feedback is a common issue, and Sony does not seem to stand by their product.

At this price range, I should get more than 1 year's worth of full-featured use out of my headphones. I won't be buying Sony headphones again.","April 4, 2023"
Amazon Customer,3,"I rarely write reviews, but considering these are premium headsets, I felt like it's warranted. My goal for these headphones were for mix of personal and business use so I wanted a headphone that could connect to multiple devices at one time and could seamlessly transition from one to the other. I wanted a headphone that could connect to my phone (Samsung Note 20 Ultra) so I can take personal calls and listen to music while I worked, as well as connect to my work computer so I can do Zoom meetings and make Google Voice calls.

I am not a sound expert, so to me, this headset provided sound and call quality that I am satisfied with. People on the other end of the line said my voice came through very clearly. They are very comfortable to wear all day and do keep out a good bit of my screaming children in the background.

My BIG gripe:
I bit the bullet and spent more for this headphone instead of the previous model and other headphones on the market because of the advertised Multipoint connection - being able to connect to two devices at the same time. So, I connected to my phone for voice and music. Everything was great - I made calls and listened to music in between calls. Then I added my computer. I was able to do Google Voice, Zoom, and listen to youtube videos just fine on the computer. The headphones were even able to toggle back and forth between the phone and the computer for voice calls and Zoom meetings.

So the big problem came in when I realized that although it was able to switch between the phone and computer for voice calls, it could not do the same for music. When the computer is connected, no music audio can be played on my phone, even when the computer is not playing anything. After messing with the various settings, using the Sony headphone app, etc, I thought, maybe I'm not doing something right. So I chatted with text support - 3 times, in case I got a chat rep who was inexperienced. But all three of them gave me the same answer - you can connect to both devices. However, you can only connect for either voice or music, you have to choose. You cannot be connected for both voice AND music on both devices. I only use my computer for work - no music or youtube, but cannot change the settings on it to remove the music. So, not being able to listen to music on my headphone in between calls on the phone and still be connected to the computer is a big bummer for me. This is especially true when I have cheap $30 earbuds from Amazon that can do this, they're just not comfortable to wear all day.

Had I known this, I would have gone with the WH-1000xm3 and saved myself the $100 difference at the time.","November 3, 2020"
Mr Lewis,3,This product can be good but with this specific headset you often get a faulty pair so if you order make sure you get the insurance with it because the volume has issues sometimes and the noise cancellation can be lack luster,"October 7, 2023"
Robert,3,"I am autistic and wanted some high quality headphones because I wear them almost all day every day.

The good:
Music sounds great, I am no expert in that.
Noise canceling works really well.
Comfortable, I’ve never worn over head headphones so long because I wear glasses and am highly sensitive. Sometimes I feel some uncomfortable pressure but I can usually wear these literally all day.

The bad
You can’t use while charging. My cheap headphones can, this is so annoying because if they die while I’m working it messes up my whole flow. It does charge fast but this to me is a huge con.

Often after charging, it won’t turn on for a few minutes after unplugging. Sometimes plugging back in and unplugging helps. I think maybe something doesn’t trigger it to let you turn in after charging right away. But it’s annoying

Pairing with 2 devices doesn’t work that well in practice. Say I’m on a video call for work on my computer. Someone calls my phone, if I’m paired to the phone it switches to the phone. Now I’m frantically trying to find my phone to unpair so I can be part of the meeting. Same thing if your phone gets a message, though less time. I started just unpairing the phone whenever a meeting started. There needs to be a way to say x device has priority right now.

Randomly the speak to chat will enable itself. I have turned off in the app many times, and it just decides to enable itself again at annoying times. One time I was using loud machines outside and my hands were dirty. The software thought the machine was my voice I guess, and so it turned off noise canceling and even seemed to amplify the noise. Pretty annoying, you can turn it back off but why do I have to keep doing that. I haven’t uninstalled their app or anything like that.

When I connect to a computer, it creates 2 devices, an audio and stereo. You have to use the audio when using the mic. And the sound quality/noise canceling is terrible on that setting. I don’t know whose fault that is, the operating system or headphones, but I hate it.

The mic quality works but I often get people saying they hear echoes or can’t understand. Other times seems fine, but I often use a different mic because of those issues.

Overall, good headphones. If they would spend some time polishing things and allow use while charging it would be 5 stars for me. Due to the cost and many small issues I can’t rate it that high","March 9, 2022"
Nicolas,3,"I had been using Airpods Pro for a while but they tend to make my ears itchy and I can't use them for long flights, so I needed something with a longer battery life.
I got these during Prime Day at a great price, but I'm still not sure they are worth it.

The audio is great, so they perform that very well.
My problems revolve around the connectivity and the dependency on the phone app, which is useless when you're not using a phone.

To start, it does pair with TWO devices at the same time, but only two, and half the time it works as it says.
If you have a phone, a tablet and a laptop, you're out of luck. In my case I have my work laptop, phone and personal laptop that I wanted to use these with. I got used to the easy switch of the Airpods Pro (Once paired, whichever device requests connection, it connects).

When connected to the two devices, it's supposed to play from whichever device is playing audio. So if you pause one and play on the other, it switches. This works... sometimes. Most of the time it won't detach from the paused one and the headphones can't be taken over, not even with the app. You have to go find that second device, go to bluetooth settings and disconnect. The $100 standard airpods handle this with grace, but the $350 sony can't.

My other gripe is the padding. While comfy, it could've been deeper. I don't think I have abnormally big ears but the edge of my ear is slightly pressed by the inside of the headphone and after 10 min it starts going numb unless I tilt the cup forward a bit or do something to find the sweet spot.

Other than those two (big to me) items, the audio is great once you turn the bass DOWN a bit and the noise cancelling tunes out a plane by like 80%. Much better than the Airpods Pro.

I might have to look into the Airpods Max I guess.

I don't fully blame Sony here, the Bluetooth protocol is a disaster from a technical standpoint, but Apple somehow made it happen, so it can be done.","July 26, 2022"
RKO,3,"As most reviews have mentioned, the noise cancellation feature on this headphone is top notch. It makes most noises disappear. If the noise doesn't disappear, it minimizes the noise. That's still better than nothing. That silence does come with a price for plastic glasses wearers.

The pleather material used on the earpads makes a rubbing noise when it come in contact with the plastic arms of my glasses. The total lack of sound created by the noise cancellation seems to amplify this noise. Every time I moved my head/face, I would hear a loud (brrrttt) noise in my headset. Unless you can keep your head/face perfectly still, you will end up hearing this noise quite often. Yes, it will drive you nuts. Microfiber earpads will help with this problem, but there are no third party microfiber earpads available.

Folks with metal frames, YMMV.

Couple of other things I've noticed:

- Out of the box, the headphones are super bass heavy. This can be fixed through the EQ on the Sony headphone app. Setting is stored on the headphones, so you can use the setting on other devices without the app.

- The headband is about 1 inch wide. It is supported by relatively thick padding. But since the band itself is so narrow, it was causing hot spots on my head.

- Like typical closed back headphones, my ears got warm/sweaty, quickly.

- I experienced some low frequency humming noises. Noise went away when I turned off noise cancellation. Not sure what noise the headphone was trying to cancel out.

- The headphone is rechargeable via USB-C to USB-C cable. Some USB-C devices don't follow specs so you have to use a USB-C to USB-A cable (similar to the one included with the headphone). But, it charges fine with a C to C cable.

- Build quality is excellent. Didn't experience the creaking noise users experienced when stretching out the headphones.

- LDAC would default to the best effort setting on my Samsung Note 10+ & Tab S7+. I can manually change it to the higher 660kbps and 990kbps setting. But, whenever I reconnect, my device would revert back to the best effort setting (adaptive bit rate).

- Bluetooth light doubles as the power on light (blue color). Very noticeable in a dark place.

Noise cancellation works well, most of the time. Unfortunately, the rest of the headphones need some work.","November 22, 2021"
K.Strange,3,"Bought these a year and a half ago. The sound quality is great, but they've gotten to a point now where they'll say they're connected to the computer but won't play any sound. When I try to turn them off and on again, they'll turn off, but then won't turn on again for like ten minutes. The battery is charged, drivers updated, but no fix. I use them for work, and multiple times a week I have to pull out the aux cable to physically connect them to the computer so that I can get any audio at all (and bye bye noise canceling when that happens). The sound and noise canceling is good, but I expect at least twice as long of a lifespan for that price tag. Won't be buying these again.","August 10, 2023"
Jenny,3,"After doing some extensive research and reading lots of reviews, I decided to pay a little more to go with the Sony's instead of the Bose or the studio beats, which are known for having ""lesser quality.""
I got them in the mail and immediately tried them out since I was so excited... only to be bummed out.

The aesthetic is really nice, they're great quality and I love how they look and feel on my ears! They're extremely comfortable and cover my whole ears. The sound quality however, is mediocre. It's GOOD, but not spectacular like a $300+ pair of headphones should sound. I'm a huge music fan and I also listen to audiobooks and podcasts- these are fine for audiobooks/podcasts but the music is sad with these on. No bass, and just does not sound ""crispy"" :(
I played some songs from my EDM playlist, lots of house and dubstep tracks. Also played some rap, indie, and reggaeton, and the sound quality of these headphones just makes everything not as hype, even when when volume is turned way up. Will be returning these asap and going with the studio beats (they're not the best but for $170 they're awesome especially when solely using them for the gym!)","May 11, 2023"
Emily,3,"I'm going to base my review off of my Airpods Pro that I have and love, but have finally given out after some time.

SOUND QUALITY:
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I think music sounds way better on the Airpods. I really expected these headphones to blow me away, but no matter which EQ settings I changed it to, they just don't hit like the Airpods Pro. It does get much louder though, but I'd rather have the sound quality.

EASE OF USE:
There are many issues here. Many of the features you would want out of the headphones have to be enabled/disabled in the app. These aren't great for zoom calls because when I take the headphones off and put them back on, it doesn't reconnect to my meeting's sound. I have to disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth to get the meeting sound again. I turned off the feature which does this in the app and it still has the same result. This is a big issue for me and actually the main reason I am returning. Connecting to bluetooth is fine. Very fast and with the android it's quite nice, just not a fan of the other experiences I've been having.

NOISE CANCELLING:
Once again, I think the Airpods Pro noise cancelling is way better than these headphones. I made sure I had it on (the lady in the headset tells you so). I can hear much more around me than with the Airpods. Especially my own voice. When I'm talking in meetings I can hear myself and I hate that. Second reason I'm returning.

COMFORT & DESIGN:
Best thing about these headphones is they are super comfortable. I could probably wear these all day if they worked better for me. The case they come in and the accessories they have are great!

Overall, not a fan and going to return. Really bummed about it given the many stellar reviews on YouTube.","August 9, 2022"
C,3,"Cons:
Ears begin to hurt after only an hour or two of use.

Does not turn off after I remove them. This ""feature"" is on in the app, and I have toggled it off and on many times hoping it would fix it. They nearly drain after staying on all night.

Reconnecting to devices is not as good as the WF-1000XM4. I've had to factory reset several times due to losing ability to reconnect to tv and I've only had them for a month.

Pros:
Sound is great

Noise cancelling is fantastic.

The comfort issue is a big one for me, if I could go back in time I would have bought something else.","August 10, 2023"
Emily Portillo,3,"I got them to use for work and my phone and at first it worked fine but as time went on, it would make my Teams freeze anytime it tried to connect or some error would occur with my laptop that I just stopped using them for any calls. I’ve had them for a little over a year and they really just sit in my backpack for emergencies. They sound nice and are noise cancelling but can’t use them for what I actually bought them for.","September 1, 2023"
r blair,3,"These are by far some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. The noise canceling is top notch in every environment I've needed to use them (mostly the office with an open concept, and airplane travel), which means I can listen to music or other content at a reasonable volume with full clarity. Having them paired to my computer and phone at the same time is a great convenience that will be a requirement when I replace them eventually. I use them for ~8+ hours a day, Monday - Friday, with minimal ear fatigue. The only downside I am aware of is that recipients on the other side of phone calls and video chats will often comment about my voice not coming through nearly as clear as others; not clear whether it's the headphones or a service connection issue.

After about a year, I started getting feedback on a regular basis when turning them on (it occurs about 90%+ percent of the time now), or occasionally midway through a listening session (maybe once out of 20-50 sessions now). If you can tolerate the popping and extremely high pitched squeal, it may sort itself out. More often though, I've had to rub my fingers over the mics on the bottom and screened opening on the top of the ear cup that is acting improperly, interrupting the feedback, and hoping to quickly get it to stop before I have to take them off from the piercing pain the feedback causes. I've tried resetting and recalibrating them, with no long term success (in fact one attempt at this resulted in the feedback immediately starting again). I contacted support to report the issue and to get any assistance to resolve it, and rather than any supportive feedback, I was simply asked to confirm my purchase date, and summarily dismissed when they discovered that my warranty had expired. These headphones have experienced no trauma, no exposure to the elements, and yet this issue is extremely predictable. It seems that there is some minor product defect that Sony does not seem to care about so long as it only becomes an issue after the warranty period has elapsed.

I would give 5* on the headphones. 2* knocked off for the feedback issue and lack of long term support.","October 19, 2022"
DENNORSKEN,3,Not compatible with my hearing impairment.,"October 24, 2023"
T,3,"I'm an old hand at noise cancelling wireless headphones. I tend to wear them all day when I work from home. I listen to music, audiobooks, phone calls and online meetings all day. I use them with a MacBook and an iPhone. I got these in the hopes that they would work better with my Mac products that my Sennheiser PXC 555-II. Those ones just shut down randomly while connected to both devices. I was told these Sony's were supposed to work especially well with Mac products. They do not.

What I like about these:
(1) Good sound quality
(2) mic works well for phone calls and online meetings
(3) long battery life, very fast recharging. (The fast recharging is my favorite part, it's really amazingly fast!)
(4) lightweight, comfortable on my head all day. But so were the Sennheiser.
(5) noise cancelling works well for ambient indoor noise

What I don't like, and can't even really understand:
(1) when connected to two devices, often I can't get sound from either device to play. So these basically cannot functionally connect to my Macbook and my iPhone at the same time.
(2) relatedly, when my Macbook is asleep, my headphones connect to that, thus making me unable to listen to audio from my phone. So I have to open the laptop to turn off bluetooth so that I can listen on my phone.
(3) when I burp (yes, burp), they headphones pause whatever is playing.
(4) the controls on the right ear are insensitive. I effectively cannot pause my audio at a touch
(5) when I receive a phone call while my headphones are connected to my iPhone, it turns the ring volume all the way down on my phone. This results in my alarm being silent the next day. This is a big problem so now I basically can't trust my iPhone alarm.
(6) adaptive noise cancelling plays a noise as it changes settings. The sounds is much louder than what I'm listening to. So if you want to go for a walk and talk on the phone hands free and a car drives by or there's a breeze, I hear a loud beep and I can't hear the person I'm talking to. I've turned off this setting as a workaround.

Overall, I regret this purchase.","February 4, 2022"

Lori,3,"For the price you'd hope it would do it all. But if you want to listen to a game and a youtube video, or do a discord call, then you need to add to the setup. It's a shame because these are incredible for music - close your eyes and it's like you're actually there.","September 13, 2023"
Jackson Birch,3,"These headphones are almost perfect. The sound quality is amazing, the noise cancellation (while way too strong for my liking) is solid, and they're very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately Sony decided that they had to ruin these amazing headphones with multiple gimmicks, all of which are located in the (required) headphones app. The least annoying of these features is probably the one I was dreading the most when I bought these headphones: the touch controls. They are surprisingly accurate and they only really have issues if you accidentally brush side with the controls against your arm or neck. Then there's the automatic pausing feature which just pauses music and videos when the headphones detect that you've removed them, this usually works but sometimes it thinks my neck is my ear and starts playing the music again after I've just removed them. The absolute worst feature is the ambient noise feature. Theoretically it's supposed to be so you can hear your surroundings when you need to and be the opposite of the noise canceling mode. In reality it's just quicker to remove the headphones and the feature in general has absolutely abysmal implementation. There are 3 ways ambient sound can activate, you manually toggle it, you speak (with the speak to chat option enabled) or you start a call. The first two make sense, but the last one kills these headphones if you want to use them for literally ANYTHING other than purely listening to music. This ambient sound mode absolutely destroys the sound quality while it is on, this is fine in most scenarios as you aren't actively listening to the sound but it activating during calls makes it so you can't even hear what the other person is saying. Unlike the other two ways to activate ambient sound, you absolutely cannot deactivate or toggle the setting while in a call, it is stuck in ambient sound mode no matter what. This also effects all other sound coming though the headphones while also amplifying any sound happening around you. It's an effectively useless feature that though forced implementation ruins these otherwise very good headphones. Look for something else unless you are 100% sure you will never use these for anything but music.","March 4, 2022"
Cory,3,"So, first off, I'll say that this headset has great active noise cancellation (ANC). I'm comparing it to a Sennheiser PXC550 which has been my go-to OTE ANC headset til now. The ANC on this one blows the PXC550 out of the park.

For sound quality, eh, it's ok. It feels pretty flat by default, and trying different equalizer settings only made it marginally better. I'm in no way an audiophile, so I assume it's pretty bad to be this noticeable. Another issue with the equalizer that you need to switch equalizer presets through the mobile app (annoying for me, since I'm using this exclusively for desktop). This also contrasts with the PXC550, which has a physical button to cycle through presets.

One feature that continues to irritate me with this headphone is that there is a slew of voice responses that cannot be disabled. ""Power on."" ""Bluetooth Device 1 Disconnected"" etc. Again, this contrasts with the PXC550, where you could at least use their app to replace all voice prompts with succinct notification sounds. Looking up the issue, it seems to be something that Sony is actively ignoring despite userbase complaints, so I wouldn't hold out hope on them changing it.

The touchpad controls also feel rather clunky. I only use it to change volume, and have to do a full swipe up/down for each tick of volume. It also semi-regularly misinterprets and tries to do something else, like pausing whatever I have playing, or turning off audio for local chat mode. This again contrasts with the PXC550 (the only other touchpad headset I've tried, admittedly), which feels pretty well-tuned and can adjust a full volume range with just a few swipes.

One other feature that Sony really tries to push is a premium (subscription) feature called 360 Reality Audio. Their marketing for it is vague to the point that I don't understand what exactly they're actually selling. My big concern is that it's some sort of pay plan-gated access to surround sound for an already premium priced headset. I'll at least give them the benefit of the doubt and say that some preliminary surround sound tests seem to work alright without this.

No report yet on battery life, but it seems that it can't both charge and play at the same time.","January 8, 2022"
Dexter McDade,3,"Purchased my Sony WH-1000xm4 on 12/23/21 with Asurion protection plan. The headphones performed well until December 2022 when the touchpad would not work and it would shut down on itself while listening music. At that time, my daily phone was my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G. Sent them to Asurion in March 2023, supposedly fixed and received them back late March. On 4/21/23, they just shut down on itself and I upgraded my phone to the new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Asurion assured they were fixed. Contacted Amazon and requested a refund from Asurion that they couldn't fixed the problem before. Counterproductive to attempt them again. Talked to another rep with Amazon regarding a phone call with Sony Customer Support. He stated they do not repair any earbuds or headphones, simply send out a new replacement. She assured that when my headphones are received at Asurion, they will refund my payment method. If I get the refund, I will simply apply the credit for the new WH-1000xm5.

Surya Bakshi,3,"This is the second of these headphones I've owned and just today, less than 1 year after buying it, the swivel on side of the headphones (the left one this time) broke during normal use without any rough usage or handling it improperly.

The first headphones the right side swivel broke (less than 1 year of owning it) and not this one as well. I recommended these headphones to a lot of my friends even after the first one broke but now I'm suspicious whether they're worth this MASSIVE price tag given the build quality seems to be suspect.

It's too bad, they're good headphones in almost every other way.","July 26, 2023"
Pragmatist: T. Frick,3,"I'm somewhat of an audiophile, certainly very discriminating when it comes to listening to music. Having been a former musician, I know what live music should sound like. I bought the Sony WH-1000MX4 when on sale (saved $100) and because of the generally good reviews I've read over the past few years.

I almost never listen to music that has been compressed (such as AAC, .mp3, etc.), because the degradation in sound quality is unacceptable to me. I prefer lossless sources, CD-quality or higher, and I find Bluetooth transmission to degrade quality somewhat, even with lossless sources.

So to start, the WH-1000MX4's are, in my judgment, good but not great. For the best fidelity, I much prefer my Sennheiser HD650 headphones. Yes, the Sennheiser's are open-back and not noise-cancelling. But for quality for hours of comfortable listening to a wide range of lossless music sources, the HD650's are my go-to (when not listening to Dolby Atmos music recordings in my living room, with B&W 804 D2 main speakers, CDM 7NT center/surrounds, and SVS SB-2000 subs).

I even prefer the Apple AirPods Pro for listening quality, when compared to the Sony 1000MX4's. While the active noise cancellation is not as good in the AirPods Pro when compared to the 1000MX4's, I still prefer the fidelity of the AirPods when the source is lossless and the environment is not too noisy.

Also, the ""eardrum suck"" phenomenon (see WireCutter article on active noise cancellation) can be an issue. At least the Sony app for the 1000MX4 allows some adjustment of the ANC level, which seems to help some in my own experience thus far. I have yet to try the Sony's on plane flights, so the verdict is out on that for me. My overall conclusion is that the ANC compromises sound quality of lossless music, especially over Bluetooth connections. I suppose that, in a very noisy environment, the compromise might be worth it. But I tend to avoid noisy environments as much as I can. The verdict is out on that, for now, until I get more opportunities to try the Sony's with my lossless music libraries.","January 15, 2022"
S.christy,3,"Bottom line; sound is just mediocre.
Out of the box these have a horrendous base shelf that drowns out all of the mids. You can attempt to tune this down with the EQ in the Sony app but it's difficult to get a proper tuning as their are only 5 preset frequency bands. The default tune of the headphone should be more balanced instead of being ridiculously boosted out of the box. Thankfully the EQ tune you set on your phone will carry over to over devices like your PC for instance; but that does not fix AUX mode. You'll always have the bad tune there. Overall detail is mediocre, as is sound-staging.

There is a sensor on the inside of one of the cups. This creates a noticeable channel imbalance. They should of balanced out their sound by having two; that way the distortion created by having the sensor would be even on both cups. This is actually what Apple did on the Max's.

You can't use the highquality LDAC codec and Bluetooth multi-point at the same time. You are forced to downgrade to SBC which significantly reduces sound quality. You end up with about a third of the data bandwidth. I don't use the feature specifically because of this.

Then there is the issue of latency. It's noticeably bad on PC; to the point where you can notice lip-desync. On mobile it's fine, but still not good enough to play a game on. You can use AUX to solve this but then you lose your EQ and worsen the problems with channel imbalance. They could of included low-latency codecs and the option to switch to them but they didn't.

What's possibly the most puzzling thing about these is that they removed aptX and aptX HD support from the last model. This is important because Windows does not support LDAC (And won't be), so your stuck with having to use SBC on Windows in all situations. Like I said earlier; about a third the bandwidth.

Everything else works fine, as other reviewers mention. I personally have no problems with the touch-pad. You can get significantly better sounding Bluetooth headphones for half the price if you do away with ANC and a few gimmicks. I got mine at a significant prime day discount and am still on the fence about it.

Eh. Still waiting for a set that combine good sound with good tech.","July 26, 2021"
N. Martin,3,"These are the most comfortable phones I've ever owned, and very close to the best sounding. (About as good as the Sennheiser 600, which I've had for years.) On that basis they are an excellent choice.

As for the rest, I don't have much good to say. The voice sensor constantly interrupts play as I sing, mumble, burp, or make a slight sound. Sometimes even when I just move my jaw in a particular way. It's unbearable unless you are entirely mute.

The sensor that pauses play when you take off the phone has failed to work properly within a few days of purchase. The most common reason is apparently condensation, but it seems that just humidity is sufficient. That you can't turn off, so you need to turn off at the source.

The implementation of Alexa is fine, but the same cannot be said of Google Assistant. It keeps informing me that it can't give me personal information without my giving permission in the Google Home app, but the phones won't show up as a device I can add in the app, so while I slightly prefer Assistant, I end up with Alexa.

I wandered around Sam's Club today, and play was interrupted constantly. I'm not sure if that was due to the voice sensor or Adaptive Sound Control, which seems like an utterly pointless feature to me. I won't be using ASC. Many times when play is interrupted, it does not restart in 30 seconds, as is supposed to happen, and even cupping the right side won't restart play, it's necessary to press the play button on the phone. An my iPhone I have to always press play twice to get it to restart.

I have no way of knowing if the ear shape analysis is of any value, but I doubt it. The phones are not bass heavy, and I prefer this neutrality. The sound is well balanced.

This product is solid for its critical features, but Sony has smothered it in bells and whistles that not only don't enhance the listening experience but substract from it. This would be a great product without the gimmicks, and probably less expensive. I agree with another reviewer that the phones are too app-dependent. I want a great product whose features are not dependent on an app.","June 22, 2021"
Joseph V. Russo,3,"I really wanted to LOVE these headphones. For me, it’s all about the ANC and I know that these are one of the top rated and reviewed ANC headphones. Before I bought them I read hundreds of reviews, as I always do and mostly all the reviews were sparkling!!! I ride the train to and from NYC 5 days a week and one of my biggest pet peeves is people talking on their phones during my train ride, I honestly can’t stand it. So I did my research and ended up buying the air pod pros. Wow wow wow!! I couldn’t hear anything!!! The ANC was truly incredible!! This was my first ever pair of ANC headphones and I blown away by almost everything about these headphones. Key word. Almost. For the life of me, I couldn’t get these buds to stay in my ears. Tried every tip, even tried off brand memory foam tips. Still would fall out. With every tip, I even did the iPhone ear test that’s in everyone’s iPhone settings. Could NEVER get a perfect seal. Ok, no problem, I’ll order bud ear hooks. They stayed in with the hooks but after awhile, I was getting frustrated taking the hooks on and off to charge. So then I went without hooks. Again, they started falling out of one ear or the other. I couldn’t take it anymore. So my wife now owns them. She works out everyday, spins everyday. She hasn’t had a dropped bud yet (knock on wood) and that’s what I’ve been reading in my research. Some ears they stay in perfectly and some ears they fall out. I was too nervous about losing one. Had to move on. So after reading countless reviews, I ended up with thsee Sony headphones. Sound quality is top notch. A plus. Battery life is phenomenal. A plus plus. ANC. Ehhh. In my opinion a C minus. On my train ride I hear too much background noise. Ughhh especially other peeps talking on their phones. :(. I just returned them and now I’m waiting for the Bose quite comfort. They have hooks, so we’ll see.

So after some more research, I’ve learned that you really can’t compare buds to over the ear muff headphones for ANC, so in my opinion, if you’re looking for the very best ANC, muffs or buds, it’s night and day. Buds are by far better for drowning out backround noise. My Bose quite comfort came and the ANC is phenomenal!","January 16, 2021"

The Corey,3,"This review is specifically for my the day to day use in Teams/Zoom, which I WOULD NOT recommend these for, especially for the price.
WTH Sony – you are one of the biggest brands on the planet, how can you not figure out Bluetooth?!? These headphones are such a pain in the arse to connect and keep connected to Teams/Zoom – basically if they are not on before starting the meeting, connected, and on your head – these headphones take at least a minute to connect, basically you get the robotic sound of death and silence while these try to connect to the computer.
1. Switching between meetings? See number 1.
2. They will just randomly drop right in the middle of the conversation – try to re-connect – see number 1 above.
3. Want a voice to randomly tell you device 1 is connected every so often, right in the middle of an important conversation, then these are the headphones for you!
4. Unlike every other pair of headphones I’ve used, including the cheap ones, I have been able to control the volume with the volume controls on the computer or device. Sony, nope – you get to either open the system volume or the teams/zoom volume setting. Do the side volume controls work on the headphones in teams/zoom? Now that would be silly, honestly what I what is to be fully blasted with sound at the start of every meeting with no other way to EASILY turn down the volume with the volume controls RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, I’d rather dig through system or application menus to control the volume.

IF you are buying these for music, to connect to a phone for calls/music, these headphones have excellent sound quality, great app controls ( even better than the Bose I returned) and are EXTREMELY comfortable to wear even all day. I can have these on for hours, they are lightweight, and the ear cushioning is soft and pliable. Bose is the go-to if your main concern is the noise canceling, it is much better there, but I enjoy these for the environmental sounds controls, and I found the overall sound quality to be much better compared to Bose.","June 8, 2021"
William J. Parry,3,"I write this as I sit in a coffee shop and can hear conversations, coffee grinding, and the background music through the noise cancellation of these headphones. I bought them specifically for their noise cancellation abilities. Based on the reviews I expected much much better. They fall entirely short on this front.

The noise quality is quite good however. If you're sitting in an already quiet place with **faint** background noise then these are a good option. However, if you, like me, work at a coworking space and need some quiet without blasting your music to full, these are not them.

Also, the user controls are terrible. The amount of times that you might try to turn up the volume only to change the song and vise versa is far too many.","June 21, 2023"
Eric,3,"I'm really conflicted with these. The noise cancellation is miles better than my QC 35 and airpods pro, and the sound quality is pretty good too. But these headphones creak to no end at the four points which connect the headband to the earcups. At first I thought it was a defective model so I got a replacement and tried to be as gingerly as possible but it started creaking again. I did some research on the XM3 and it seems these were an issue for those too. If you don't move your head at all it's fine but any movement of the head or jaw causes these creaking noises at those hinges. I really want to keep these because the noise cancellation is that good but when the headphones themselves cause distracting noises I don't know that I can justify these for $350. Maybe $250 for the XM3's and I can put up with the creaking noises but at this price point it's very difficult.

Other complaints are fairly minor. Basically all the ""features"" that are advertised (not sure how many of them were also in the XM3's) are pretty gimmicky. The whole ""put one hand over the right ear cup when ordering a coffee""? Just slide the ear cup back and avoid looking like a goof. 19 levels of noise cancellation? I bought these for the max so cancel out the distractions in the back. The ambient sound noise works I guess but the microphones pick up wind noises too much and the headphones shifting around the head when walking make it more difficult to use - airpods pro transparency mode does this a lot better. The whole speak to put your headphones into ambient sound mode temporarily is super annoying. The only useful feature is the two connections, which is new to the XM4's. I personally don't like the pause music when lifting up the left ear cup because if I'm on a call and I lift it up to scratch my ear (which you will do a lot because your ear touches the inside walls of the headphones) and I put it back, my spotify will suddenly start ploying music again. Again, not a huge deal since the noise cancellation is that good. If only the headphones didn't creak so much, it would be well worth the $350. I'll use it for another two weeks to see if there is a ""break in"" period and the headphones stop creaking but if they don't, I'll have to make a tough choice on whether to keep them or return them.","September 27, 2020"
Edil,3,"1) General sound quality listening music and movies is good.
2) White noise cancellation is good.
3) Problem is when you want full noise cancellation in high wind conditions, that includes outdoors or even indoors if you are using a high airflow fan (for example I have a 10,000 CFM ceiling fan). In high wind conditions for some reason the mics pickup the noise of the wind and the electronics do not cancel it. You can hear it loudly I'm not saying that the wind noise get amplified but since all the other noise are reduce the effect, the perception is as if the noise produced by the wind gets amplified affecting your hearing experience.","June 23, 2023"
C2k,3,"I absolutely love these headphones! Best, most incredible sound I've ever gotten from headphones/earphones. Miles beyond anything I've purchased up to $200. But for the love of God, BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN!

Pros:
I love the features, the touch controls, and the customization available thru the app (that you have to install to use them). I find myself looking for music in 2160p because you can clearly hear the difference, it's almost transformative. Great battery life, love the auto power-off feature, and very comfortable with glasses.

Cons:
I had to replace these once during the manufacturer warranty, got a brand new pair. Had issues where they stopped charging entirely. After a new pair, they broke again in less than a year with a very similar issue; they stopped charging and eventually the battery smelled like it burned up. The Asurion plan was better than nothing, but the price went up plus I had to purchase a more expensive plan, so I still had to pay $100 to replace em. I use a 165W 4-port charger and quality Anker cables. I charge almost everything on this from phones at super fast charge 2.0, to headphones, flashlights, small devices, etc without any issue, so I doubt it's the charger/cable causing them to burn out. But 2 pairs in less than 2 years?
Also the app could use some work. Connecting to 2 devices can be frustrating when it keeps trying to switch (or won't switch from) one device. Can't tell you how many times I've just removed the 2nd device. Also sometimes resets certain settings, I've had to turn off ""speak to chat"" many times because it randomly turns on.

Final verdict
Incredible sound and features, no longevity and app could use some work. I still recommend these for the sound, but buy the protection plan for your wallets sake!","August 8, 2022"
Jared,3,"I was very pleased with these headphones for several months. I really loved them, to be honest. But one day, as I was taking them off, the right earpiece snapped at the hinge and made them unwearable. It's okay, these - things happen, right? So I file a claim with the insurance and mail the headphones in to be repaired.

After waiting two weeks, I'm informed the headphones cannot be repaired, (uh...okay? Really? The wires weren't even messed up - just the plastic casing for the swivel hinge). So they refunded my account the amount of purchase.

...Annoying, but fine. I go to repurchase the headphones. This time to get a refurbished pair...the quality was guaranteed, and I'm not picky. Might as well save a hundred bucks. Shipping guaranteed in one week. No problem.

A week goes by. I get an update that the product has yet to ship. There's been a delay that isn't explained. Okay, no big deal. it's a pandemic, shipping is hard, no worries. Another two weeks go by, and I get another unexplained delay. It's still fine. No big deal.

Then a month goes by and I get a final notice that they simply don't know when they'll have the product on hand to send me, and I can either cancel the order, or just wait indefinitely to be notified of when they're available again.

Look, I get it. I went for the refurbished. I wanted to save a buck. I'm not a rich dude, these were a splurge item that I saved for. I had a chance to get some money back after waiting for a return, so I took it. But $350 headphones shouldn't break in regular daily use like six months after purchase. And I should be able to pretty easily have them replaced without going through a useless insurance claim and then a cat and mouse game with a refurbishing warehouse somewhere in New Jersey.","September 10, 2021"
Tyler R,3,"First, I must say I only had these for about a week. During that week I fell in love with these headphones, although a faulty battery required me to return them and jaded me from Sony products for awhile.
My initial impressions of these upon receiving them was a sense of quality and comfort. Big 'ole earpads that swallowed my ears in comfort and just the right amount of clamp force. Pairing was painless and consistent. One feature I liked was that your volume level stayed with the headphones even after turning them off. The pair I bought after these (Audio Technica ATH-SR50BT) does not do that and it is a hassle to constantly pump up the volume every time I turn these on.
Sound quality, wow oh wow! The sound on these is pretty good. I enjoy a good amount of bass and these do not disappoint. These, by no means, are flat headphones. There is an audible dip down in the mids and mid-highs. Certain instruments and vocals seem muted. A quick change of a few EQ values fixed that and brought out the amazing sound quality these headphones are capable of.
The reason I no longer own them was because of a charging/battery issue. I found it odd that for about 4 days the in-app battery indicator didn't budge from 100%. Then all of a sudden I get the audible prompt to charge these headphones because they are at 10%. I dug out the supplied cable and attached them to my charger for approximately 5 hours and turned them on. As soon as I turn them on I get the same ""please charge"" prompt. So I cycle the power switch a few times and place them back on charge for 3 hours. At the end of all that the same thing happens, ""please charge"". Unfortunately these jaded me against Sony products as they were once top tier electronics, but my past 5 years experience with Sony products has proven otherwise.","August 30, 2021"
RcarL,3,"These headphones are my first set of nicer headphones. I splurged on Prime Day and decided to try them out. I previously used a set of pretty cheap noise-canceling wireless headphones- and I assumed that the much more expensive Sony ones would far exceed the sound quality and features of the lower quality set.

After about two weeks of use, I'm a bit indifferent. Yes, the sound quality is better with these Sony headphones. There's an app that lets you adjust things, but after two weeks, I'm really struggling on how these are are worth the price premium of a set that cost half as much.

If you are sitting down or not moving, these do sound much better than the cheaper set. The problem is when you move- say you are wearing them while taking a walk or just moving from room to room- the sound quality can deteriorate pretty quickly- not because the headphones fall out of Bluetooth range- but rather because they seem to vibrate on your head as you walk- which creates some rather unpleasant sounds as the ear cushions move slightly on your head. It's super annoying... because the none of the cheaper sets of wireless noise-canceling headphones that I've owned did that.

Secondly, something that other reviewers have noticed- is that the pivot or joint between the headband and actual piece that covers your ear feels very, very cheap. I'm constantly afraid that I'm going to break it. Almost everything else about these headphones feels like it's pretty good quality- but those joints are very flimsy.

In the end, I'm glad that I bought these on Prime Day- which is why I'm not returning them. At full price, they just don't seem worth the cost.","July 31, 2022"
NikkiBast,3,"These are great for my phone, but they constantly lose connection to my computer (a Mac). If I'm going to spend so much for a headphones, I'd want them to work with both. My last Sony headset lasted for 8 years and easily connected to both, so I know it's not my Mac's fault.","August 17, 2023"
Kris,3,"I bought this headset primarily for work. Since transitioning to working from home several months ago, I've spent 5+ hours a day on phone calls and video conference, and wanted something comfortable and noise cancelling that had a great battery life.

First, the positives:
- The sound is great. There's good range when I listen to music, and the voices in calls are clear
- They're comfortable. I can wear them all day without them hurting my ears or the sides of my head
- Battery life really is 30 hours. I've been using them for 5-6 hours a day since I got them almost 2 weeks ago, and have only had to charge them a couple of times

The negatives are things are mostly related to the multipoint connect and the app, which honestly never even occurred to me when I was picking them out:
- Some of the videoconference apps are flaky with this headset. Skype and Zoom are fine, but when I use Teams or Webex, people can hear me, but get no audio. These work fine when I switch to my 5+ year old bluetooth headset, so I'm pretty sure it's not a setting on my Mac
- The Pause function doesn't work right on the computer. If I move the headset off my ear while I'm on a video conference, it automatically starts any video on any tab I had open when I put it back on. I keep a lot of tabs open, so sometimes it takes me a minute to find the youtube video it randomly restarted
- Weird and constant little beeps in the background. This only seems to happen when I'm connected to Mac as my second device, and I still haven't figured out why, but it's really distracting
- Multipoint doesn't always connect to the alternate device correctly. If I'm watching a video on my computer and a call comes in, I'll hear it ring, but when I pick up, it doesn't automatically switch top the headset, and I have to select the headset as my audio input on my iPhone

I really think most of these things are just bugs with the app or firmware that will get ironed out, but be aware that if you're using this mostly for work, you may be a little frustrated by some of the functionality.","September 3, 2020"
Clarice Lee,3,"Pros: Nice noise canceling effect

Cons:
1. The microphone quality is really, really bad. Others tell me that my voice sounds muffled and they can't hear me clearly. Consider that it doesn't have a microphone.
2. Having the 'Speak to chat' feature' is much worse than having a low-quality microphone or no microphone. the 'Speak to chat' feature is annoying. Even if you can turn it off, it may turn on automatically if you pair it to a device that could use a microphone. If it thinks you're speaking, even if
you're just humming with the music, the 'Speak to chat' gets turned on, and everything you hear starts to sound weird.
3. The pad is too soft. At first, I feel comfortable because of the soft pad. But later, I found out the pad gets compressed too easily that it cannot sustain enough space for my ears. It makes the inner walls slightly press against my ears and make my ears uncomfortable if I wear it for a while.
4. Possible buggy battery recharging. After 2 months, it became reluctant to recharge even if it has lower than 50% battery. I have to plug and unplug the cable several times to make it start to recharge","December 9, 2022"
Small Forest,3,"**EDIT** Battery life is really poor with ANC enabled. I lose about 10% of battery life every hour with ANC enabled. I just figured out how to disable ANC so I'll need to find out how good (or not) batter life is in that mode

The Sony headphone app is convoluted, confusing and cumbersome, or put more clearly - I don't care for it at all. Navigating the app is not at all pleasant or intuitive. I'm not a fan of the ""earcup finger slide"" controls either. Seems unnecessarily complicated to me without delivering any discernible benefit or user experience enhancement. I would be much happier with some physical buttons or sliders.

Speaking of audio quality, my take on the audio delivered by the XM4 is while it really is very good, it's only ""average for the class,"" certainly nothing out of the ordinary for the price. My Audeze XL-8's are likely as good in that regard but the XL-8's are not Bluetooth capable, so there's that. I haven't worn the XM4's outside yet so I can't comment on noise cancellation, but I'm guessing it's excellent.

Fit and comfort: The XM4's are very difficult to keep in place. They constantly slide off my head either to the front or back (and I definitely do have them on correctly - right side vs. left side). No idea what the issue is as clamp force feels as tight as I'd ever want it to be

There have been a couple of ""notifications"" that something on the XM4 needs to be updated, and telling me to ""click here to get the update."" ""Clicking Here"" takes me to the Apple app store and abandons me there with NO indication of whatever it is that I'm supposed to ""get."" I turned on ""automatically keep software updated"" in the Sony app and I'm now hoping for the best while planning to ignore any future ""get updates"" notices

Summing up: If I had been able to give them a try before purchasing I think it's quite unlikely that I would have paid so much for them or even purchased them at all regardless of cost","February 14, 2021"
Skip,3,"Yesterday, my WH-1000xm4 headset announced: “Power is 100%” and then shut down, while I was talking to someone on the phone. Today, the on-off button will not turn the headset on or off.
I bought this headset from Amazon on March 4, 2022. The headset has a one-year limited warranty. Today, is May 16, 2023. After running diagnostics, Sony TS referred me to the repair facility in the US. The repair facility quoted me $90 (base rate-labor) + $20 return shipping + parts. I called Sony and noted that the headset was 2+ months out of warranty. Sony responded that they would not do anything.
Today, when I click “Buy it again”, Amazon’s retail price is $348.00.
I went to the BBB website and Sony has a rating of 1.08/5 stars based on 53 customer reviews.

Mike,3,"First and foremost, I purchased this headphone for critical music listening, meaning, being on the move while commuting or at the gym, noise canceling quality and taking calls on my headphones, ultimately was not a priority for me. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed considering the price and high reviews. In short, I returned these headphones and purchased a set of Shennheiser 560s; less frills, much better audio quality.

My setup is playing lossless hires music through an ifi hipdac (don’t hesitate and just buy it). I tried and really wanted to love the Sony xm4, but the issue is with a bluetooth setup you’re not getting the hires lossless audio content and once you wire the xm4, you lose a lot of the Sony app customization settings. The sound on these headphones, for me sounded over eq, didn’t preserve a neutral sound and mids sounded muddy to me. The Sennheiser sounds so much more neutral and clear allowing the eq of the musical engineers and producers the platform to tell their story the way it was meant to be heard. The mids and highs really shine on the Sennheiser. One listen and I knew I’d be returning the Sony’s.

One other issue I encountered, and this was my first set of noise canceling cans, is a sense of pressure which made it very uncomfortable to listen to. I found myself removing the headphones to allow my ears some comfort. I thought it would pass after a few sittings, but it didn’t. I don’t have this issue with my AirPods Pro (used mainly for calls).

Now if you care about noise cancelation, tethering your headphones for calls and the other frills that come with the Sony’s and music quality is last on the priority list, then stick with the Sony’s. But if you’re looking for comfort and audio quality first and foremost, look elsewhere.

Good luck with your quest.","July 7, 2021"

PROS:
- Audio quality is is very good. Clarity, bass etc. is excellent.
CONS:
- Poor battery life. Only runs for a couple of hours at most before needing recharge and I need to switch to something else for an hour or so until this charges.
- No status LED to say whether it is on, off or connected. This is a very basic feature that is major shortcoming
- Ultra sensitive to touch or talking, causing NC mode to switch or audio to pause suddenly.

Daniel Olops,3,"Bought the Sony WH-1000XM4 and the Bose NC 700, so I could test both and choose one. Use cases: home office, small children, lots of conference calls, sometimes taken on the go. I'll use it with both my work laptop (Mac), my phone (Android), and my keyboard (home and church). I was looking for great noise cancellation, decent call quality, and versatility as the key aspects.

Overall, the Sony outperforms the Bose one. Superior noise cancellation, a high quality codec (LDAC) - although you lose multipoint connectivity when using it -, and a feature-rich app. Sound is a bit too bassy on the mid-bass frequencies, and a bit lackluster on the highs, but you may be able to tailor that with the 5-band EQ + dedicated bass. It isn't as comfortable as the Bose, at least for me (big head + glasses), and cabin pressure is higher when ANC is at the maximum, but I could live with that.

What put me off of keeping it were two things:

* Call quality: in a quiet environment, both Sony and Bose sound alright, as far as boomless headphones go. But in noisy environments, Sony captures all background noise. The Bose does a _great_ job at reducing noise, and my voice sounds clearer. I can attend conference calls while walking my children to school just fine with the Bose. I don't have such confidence with the Sony.
* Durability: you'll find reviews of people whose headphones broke above the earcup after months time, and Sony apparently doesn't claim responsibility. It does look too plasticky for premium headphones anyway, and I don't feel confident at spending 300-odd dollars on something that may break like that.

Although I find the Bose a bit dull-sounding and feature-lacking, I'm keeping it. Unfortunately, it appears to me that more premium alternatives such as the Bowers & Wilkins PX7, Master & Dynamic MW65, and Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, all sound better, but fall short of the key aspects I care about.","August 13, 2021"
jpbevcv,3,"It's headphone sale season, late 2022, so I'll chime in.
- The noise cancelling is awesome, but can't perform miracles. You'll still hear noise on most planes. Speaking may get through.
- Sound quality is fine, but these are not audiophile cans. For one, the noise cancelling adds noise. As it blocks all kinds of rumble it concurrently introduces hiss. I also don't get the open soundstage you'll find with higher quality headphones.
- Comfort - Taking off a star hear, at least. Much too tight for my cranium. I need to put these on a basket ball for a week, at least. Also very hot. Don't even think about making these go-to units on a treadmill, or in any warm environment.
- Design / Functionality - Another star off. Controls are not intuitive. How long do you hold down a button, etc. If you sneeze, the noise control shuts off. There is an app for all of this, sure, but I don't find that intuitive either. Buy a headset mic if you want to talk. Leave my headphones alone.

Would I buy again. Not without a fit test of the Bose or others first. These are not comfortable. I'll update my review if the basketball hack helps.","November 28, 2022"
C and E hyb,3,"Wow !!! At first I was extremely disappointed that they didn’t seem to sound like the ones I heard on display at a local store, so I researched how to get the best sound out of these so I could hopefully match what I heard. I succeeded and it was very quick and easy. The source of your music and quality stream is very very importantThe EQ can work wonders and there are easy tutorials to follow made by bona fide audiophiles that can have your music sounding beautiful, punchy ( just the right amount rather than muffled or muddy). Just turning off ANC and selecting DSEE extreme (upscales music quality detail through Sony proprietary tech) make a very big difference. The ANC is wonderful. Transparency mode ( or Ambient sound mode as Sony calls it) works well, but to be honest, if transparency mode is really important to you, Apple AirPods Pro are utterly amazing —the best). I have always been a Bose guy and it was hard to imagine that these could challenge my Bose Bias from the past. I tried these and then got ahold of some Bose 700 ( Bose top-shelf competitor for Sony XM3/4) to compare. Sound detail: ( quality/detail, soundstage, power, Customization ( EQ, etc) and ANC are clearly superior to Bose. Call quality is less than impressive to be honest. It works but not great. Bose 700 have this hands down. Final verdict: the win clearly goes to Sony. This may not help but I also have the AirPods Pro and they don’t have quite the soundstage/detail as Sony but if you are going to use these to make calls and will be mobile a lot where having big cans on your head may not be practical ( in the car or walking around the store), I would choose the AirPods. Transparency mode and the overall noise canceling quality on AirPods are unbelievable. The sound is really good also ( Sony is better on to be sure). I do hope this review helps someone out there trying to decide between the three mentioned here. Bottom line is you will really enjoy these","August 27, 2020"
Brian Sullivan,3,"I have Bose 700, Sony XM3, and now Sony XM4. They're all great.

Noise canceling: Sony XM4 and even XM3 seem to be superior noise canceling to Bose, not huge but noticable difference.

Sound quality: Sony have better bass, but again not huge difference. I don't really notice difference between MX3 and MX4.

Other stuff:
- Bose wins with at being able to connect to 2 bluetooth devices, eg ipad and phone. And it pretty seemless 'just works'. MX3 is limited to one device. MX4 supports it but I always have issues with it.. eg when enabling if I watch video on my phone the audio is delayed a bunch. -- Disable 2 device supprot and delay is gone. Or it'll like get stuck on one device sometimes, I dunno I get super annoyed with it. I've had 0 issues with Bose and on MX4 got so annoyed I disabled feature.

- Battery life with all of them is fine. Sure more is better, but in practice I have no idea which device gets longest battery life.

- The capacitive touch gestures and stuff on all of them suck. If lay in bed and put my hand behind my head my arm might touch headphones and go to check chapter in audio book. Accidental touches are so annoying I turn off all the touch stuff. I wish they'd have actual buttons, eg QC35 or whatnot.

- Sony fold up more. It's come in handy a few times wanting to put them in jacket pockets or something.

Again all are so close whatever you get you won't reget it. If you've got XM3 IMO not worth upgrading to MX4.","December 27, 2021"
Evenangel,3,"I am autistic. The headphones help me with noise sensitivity.

Noise cancellation: Quality is better than on my previous MPOW headphones.

Bluetooth: Not as stable as on my previous MPOW. I'm in the exact same setting using the same devices, so those variables haven't changed. And, even though the headphones can connect to multiple devices at once, the shaky bluetooth connection just doesn't make that a good experience for me.

Sound quality: I am not an expert. They sound fine to me. My colleagues have said I sound great and have virtually no background noise when I am on video or phone calls with them. For music, movies and videos, my husband says they don't sound as good as his Sennheisers. I tend to trust his judgment on that because he does audio production. I can't compare them to Bose though.

App: It's only available on the phone. I use my headphones primarily on my computers. So, if I want to use the app at all or update the firmware, I have to disconnect the headphones from my computer and connect to my phone.

Other features: Certain tabs on the right ear skip tracks, start and stop, and trigger voice activation. I accidentally activate these features a lot when I touch or pull off headphones on the right ear. They also don't work reliably. Very annoying. I would prefer actual buttons than a large tab surface.

Would I re-purchase these? Probably not. For the price, I don't think they are the best value for me. But I will use them until they die or something better comes along.","January 3, 2022"
Trevor,3,"They sound great, the noise cancelling is great, and overall I am happy. These are my issues:

1. The ""Custom"" button:
I sure hope in the future they add more functionality here. The choice of either alexa or ambient sound control seems like a strange dilemma for users. The two features are completely unrelated and yet both very useful. The headphones are advertised with alexa support, but if I choose to use it, I must have my phone available at all times if I want to be able to change the ambient sound modes which I do quite often. It seems the headphones already have capabilities for recognizing things like single-click, double-click, and long-press, so perhaps there is a way we could have both features at the same time.

2. Multipoint connection (2 devices) / conference call interruption :
The multipoint, 2 device connection is an awesome idea in theory, unfortunately, I have no ability to give either device priority. If 2 devices are playing sound at the same time, it is up to the phone to decide which one to connect with. If I am in the middle of a conference call this is problematic. If one device starts playing it takes over the sound and it will not switch back until that device stops playing sounds. I wish I had some control over this. I would like to have the ability to choose the device manually if needed. Furthermore, LDAC is not supported with this option. It would be more convenient if I had a list of previously connected available devices that I could just select rather than have them connected ""simultaneously"" and lose the sound quality. Automation is great, but sometimes its nice to be able to manually choose without having to constantly de-register devices.

Ultimately, the sound is great (after performing a software update) but the interface and available features leave a lot to be desired. Many of the advertised features are there, but they are not user friendly. I am hoping for another big update, as some minor tweaks to the interface would make them the perfect headset for work and play.","October 28, 2020"
Amazon Customer,3,"Primarily used for music, podcasts, and audio books. Purchased Jan 2021 from Amazon. Died March 2023.
Put them on yesterday and received an extremely loud screeching sound in the right ear cup. Loud enough to be harmful to your hearing. Had to Google and found this is not an unusual event. I take very good care of my headphones. Turns out this is a known defect and you can find ways to resolve it on YouTube. You will have to take the earphones apart and remove and clean the speaker and the filter. You will probably destroy the filter but just leave it off. The day before this happened I was at BB Trying to choose between the Apple Max, Bose 700, and XM5. I have fixed my XM4’s but will not buy the 5. At todays prices I should not be repairing them already.","March 18, 2023"
B.A.,3,"I have used Bose in-ear noise-canceling headphones for a while. I wanted to try an over the ear headphone. After a long time reviewing my option, I decided to buy a Sony headphone. It came, and I used it for about two weeks; here are what I found.

It is a great headphone overall. It has a lot of bells and whistles in its app. However, I am not a fan of having so many options. Especially when they are not being set right by default. I give you an example. It has a multipoint connection feature, which is a good thing to have.
Additionally, it has a sensor that, by default, pauses what you are listening to when you take it off and unpause when you wear the headphone. The issue is that on a few occasions, it unpaused on my other devices that I was not listening to when I took the headphones out. I can disable this feature in the app. However, why add a half-baked feature which can annoy the user?

Here is the list of pros and cons for this headphone:

Pros:
- Great noise canceling
- Nice build
- Nice case
- Comfortable to wear
- USB-C charging
- Fast charging
- Regular headphone jack port for wired connection
- Long battery life
- Auto-off

Cons:
- It gives my wife and me a headache after less than an hour of usage.
- It has too many bells and whistles that are not implemented well in some cases. You need to dig deep into the app and change the default to make the headphone behavior better.
- Touch control is not easy to use, and it frequently does something other than what I wanted it to do.
- Slower to connect than Bose headphones.

If I didn't get headaches, I would have kept it. I also bought Bose QC 35 II to compare, and Bose headphones did not give me headaches, so I am returning this and keep the Bose one. Headache is probably a personal thing and might not happen to everyone, so if you don't get a headache, I would recommend this headphone.","September 14, 2020"
AP,3,"I am by no means an expert when it comes to audio equipment and headphone sound quality. I purchased this set while on sale, and got a decent deal. With that being said, having read as many reviews anywhere I could read reviews on premium wireless headphones with noise cancellation. I am a little disappointed with the end product.

Noise cancellation works, but that is never really something that I look for, as it applies to me. I did have a pair of Bose QC25s that I felt were better with the noise cancelling.

The sound quality is great, don't get me wrong. Sony knows what they're doing. I would choose these over any Bose headphones any day. I don't like how Bose tells you how to listen to your music. One thing that I'm not so sure about, is needing the companion application from Sony. I understand, I guess, it's purpose? But I'm not entirely sold on it.

My biggest issue, though it may not be the same with others. Is the fact that there is some serious latency issues. Watching videos, movies, playing mobile games. I'm not using a lemon of a device either. I have the Note 20 Ultra, which at the time of this review, is ""top of the line"" so it can't be a software/hardware issue. If I'm dropping this kind of cash on headphones, I sort of expect there not to be such insane delays. My almost 2 year old Galaxy Buds have zero latency issues, and I only paid about $75 for them when they were on sale at my local Costco.

In all. These aren't bad. If you have the cash to blow, and don't care about lag issues, these are great. I am returning mine, and will be purchasing another set of wired, probably Audio-Tecnnicas because they've never let me down, or disappointed me such as these have.","March 31, 2021"
Kindle Customer,3,"Purchased Dec 2021. Great sound for about 18 months, then these headphones tried to destroy my hearing. One side developed an incredibly loud, high pitched, feedback screech anytime I turned on active noise cancelling. This should not be happening to a $300 set of headphones after only 18 months. I contacted customer support and all they could offer was instructions on how to do a factory reset (ineffective), and the address of the repair center. I think any product with a potentially harmful to your health defect should offer some sort of an extended warranty. Not nice Sony.","June 10, 2023"
Luis Perez,3,"When I first put these on, I was blown away by the noise canceling that I couldn’t help but giggle at just how impressive it was. Deep rumbling sounds like the hums from appliances or engines of cars disappear with the noise cancellation (it’s almost like they aren’t going even there). The pressure can get a bit uncomfortable when used for long periods of times, so be sure to be wary of that. The padding is quite comfortable compared especially with my old Sony WH-CH700N. Plus, the build and looks are a vast improvement. The app is also easy enough to understand and fun to mess with to tune it how you want. It also features touch controls that can be tricky sometimes when you just want to adjust your headphones but are functional and simple. You can also use these in transparency mode which allow you to hear the things around you a little more clearly when cupping your hand along the right ear cup. I love these headphones, they are truly my favorite pair of Bluetooth headphones on the market to this day; however, I may feel like I got a faulty pair. They keep turning off at seemingly random times even when they are fully charged. I thought it was because I was laying down and I accidentally pressed the off button, but it happened more times after that when I was sitting up or going for walks. I use these mainly for the noise canceling, so you can image my frustration when they just shut off and I am then blasted with the sounds I was trying to silence.","February 18, 2022"
Arthur Camuso,3,"The sound is good but I wanted even better. While the noise cancelation is pretty cool it bothers my ears and I don't see myself using it in the future very often. It also always defaults to that setting which is annoying. A lot of the controls are just ... bad. Side Note I got this at a discounted $278 price.

Sound Quality:
Good sound quality but really fatigues my ears with and without noise cancelation. A problem I never had before. This is the main reason I will be returning them. And why no AptX Codec? I've read some technical reviews saying most phones don't use the top bandwidth LDAC codec and that the at lower bandwith this Codec is worse. While I likely couldn't tell this still annoys me they give me the option of AptX.

Daily Use:
Annoying. But I do like the case it comes with. Give me buttons!! I've been wearing these on my walks in the winter and I can't change the song or skip without taking off my gloves AND jacket hood. If I have a hood it ignores my touches likely due to the fact the old versions would pause very easily with light touches. Pause to speak sounds like a cool idea unless you actually use it. And the headphones auto-pause feature often doesn't work when taking the headphones off and putting them on my head. If I pause the music with a tap on the side control and then take the headphones off later the music actually starts when I take them off my head... and obviously turn off when I put them back on again. Very annoying.

Overall I feel like I expect more from a premium product from a usability standpoint at the very least. The sound is more of a personal thing which some people may not mind. I would not get these unless you NEED good noise cancelation.","January 9, 2021"
A guy,3,I was excited to get this but i was disappointed when i got the headphones. When you turn the sound up a little everybody around you hears your music too! Lol what’s the point if they can’t even do their job,"July 16, 2023"
Nexxus,3,"Decided on these to replace my QC35’s that I handed down to my son. Nearly every review out there puts these as the “new king” of ANC headphones.
The “premium feel” that others describe is actually just a soft-touch, rubberized finish. It’s pleasant to the touch, but in no way, premium.
Followed the directions and downloaded the app and used it to pair my iPhone with the headphones. Smooth and seamless. Easy.
Put them on and played my reference tracks. Sounded good, and after a few minor tweaks of the EQ sounded great.. exciting, even.
Wanted to see how they sounded wired through my stereo, and they let me down a little. They sounded good, but I expected more detail in the mids... that’s okay though... these aren’t my only headphones, and I didn’t buy them for that.
Time to try the “industry leading” noise cancelling... and here’s where real disappointment set in. I’ve experienced similar ANC on headphones that cost half as much, over a year ago... used the app to tweak the ANC, and tried it in several different environments, and it’s just average.. Average...over a year ago, at half the cost.
Now I’m wondering what I just paid for, so I head over to Sony’s website to look at the specs, and discover there’s no water resistance.
I wrongly assumed that headphones at this price point were IPX4 at a minimum... rain, snow, sweat, mist... These have nothing. Nada.
I was going to keep them anyway because they were heavily discounted on Prime Day, and I’m complacent, however... after about 30 hours (one battery charge) the left side started arbitrarily cycling between ANC and ambient modes. That was it for me. Returned them.
Here’s my breakdown:

Likes:
Sound quality
Comfort
Battery Life

Dislikes:
Average noise cancelling
NO water resistance
Feel cheap (feel like $200 headphones)

I would consider these a buy at $230. That’s what I’d be willing to spend on them.","October 22, 2020"
GFY,3,"These have amazing noise canceling and the sound quality is absolutely amazing. The noise canceling is Super adaptive to my environment. I put these at 3 stars because the microphone is awful. I was hoping to use these for work (I work from home full time), but the mic quality’s awful. It will be good for a couple minutes sometimes more, and then become super tiny. I’ve had to leave calls and change headphones because it’s so bad. Worse is that the cord that was provided to plug in to a device doesn’t have a mic. I don’t understand why they would produce headphones with a headphone cord that doesn’t have a mic in this age. Do not get these if you want to use them in a professional environment. I’m pretty displeased with this product. I can use them for noise canceling which is great (I’m very sensitive to loud noise that’s why I wanted them) but I also needed headphones that would work for work.","January 13, 2023"
Kindle Customer,3,"Well, I wanted to like this so bad. I needed to upgrade a 5 year old pair of Bose QC35s I loved dearly and have put through hell and back. I didn't love the design of the Bose 700s and wanted more modern ANC features than the QC35ii, so I chose these after plenty of research. First of all, the sound is way better, though unsurprisingly no where close to my open back Sennheisers. Still much much better than my original QC35s. Noise canceling was surprisingly uninspiring, it really didn't strike me as any better than what my 5 year old pair can manage, though the ambient settings were nice.

Unfortunately, I HATED the ear cup design. So much so that I actually ended up deciding to exchange these for a pair of the QC35ii's because at least I know those will be very comfortable. I have a fairly small ears, and my ears touched the inside of the headphones. The foam inside the ear cups really isn't all that smooth or comfortable, and would definitely catch on my earrings over a lifetime of frequent use. This also caused my ears to get very warm even when wearing these for only a short period while sitting in a cool room. I can't imagine how they'd feel outside on a hot day. And lastly, and least significantly, the faux leather on the ear pieces is definitely less comfortable than the Bose. This wouldn't be a deal breaker for me on it's own, but with everything else, these really aren't headphones I'd be able to wear regularly, much less for the amount of time I'll be wearing these.

I'd definitely recommend these for those less sensitive to ear comfort or wanting something primarily for short travel rather than day to day wear, but otherwise not so much...","March 23, 2021"

drew,3,"Sony must have some really good marketing/PR folks working for them because I've never seen such rave reviews from so many ""independent"" 3rd party reviewers that all seem to have missed the mark. I can honestly say I've never felt so bamboozled by ""the internet"" into making a purchase. CNET, soundguys, rtings, techradar, tomsguide, digital trends... you name it and they're wetting themselves with excitement over these things.

Here's where these headphones...

*WIN*:
1. Noise canceling
2. Audio quality (actually depends on what type of music you listen to)
3. Included accessories (case, headphone splitter, cable for wired listening, airplane headphone jack connector)

*LOSE*:
1. Literally everything involving the App/Software
2. Taking calls/videos on your laptop
3. Multiple device pairing = a complete load of you-know-what
4. Length of the charging cord

*AVERAGE*:
1. Comfort
2. Build quality
3. Looks
4. Controls (controlling the volume sucks though)
5. Portability

If ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS NOISE CANCELING AND ABOVE AVERAGE AUDIO QUALITY, then get these headphones. I personally expect more than this in a top-end, $350 headphone. To me, these two features are the bare minimum that must be met, and are by no means differentiators that would justify such a price tag. It would honestly be better if Sony marketed these for what they are: great ANC and sound quality with good battery life. But instead they tout a handful of other features that range from average to downright awful, and this is where they lose me.

My biggest grievance with these headphones is the negligent lack of design and build for the WfH consumer. I can't believe how shoddy the multi device pairing feature is, and how buggy/glitchy the headphones are when joining calls/videos on laptops. My $200 Bose SoundLink headphones from 4 years ago are better than these headphones at this simple task.","February 2, 2021"

brian,3,"The sound quality and noise-cancellation are great, but they are annoying to use because of a ""guidance voice"" that cannot be completely disabled. It is loud and immutable. For example:

Every time you turn the headphones on you will hear a beep then a voice say ""Power On.""
Every time you turn the headphones off you will hear a beep then a voice say ""Power Off.""
Every time you connect a Bluetooth device you will hear a beep then a voice say ""Bluetooth connected.""
Every time you disconnect a Bluetooth device you will hear a beep then a voice say ""Bluetooth disconnected.""

When you use your headphones everyday this voice grows more annoying. In the associated app there is an option to disable ""Notification & Voice Guide,"" but that only disables part of the voice guide. There is no way to completely turn it off. I searched online for a fix but it appears its built into the functionality of the headphones. I even contacted Sony Support hoping for help. Here is an excerpt of my chat with a Sony Support agent:

Me:
I have set ""Notification & Voice Guide"" to off, but the voice still announces when bluetooth
connects/disconnects and when power goes on/off. Is there anyway to disable this part?

Support Agent:
Sadly, I'm afraid that certain voice lines are directly built-in to the functionality of the headphones. This is for helping you know the current state of the headphones, but also to make sure the headphones actually
work and output sound. I apologize for the inconvenience, but that's the most we can disable the Voice Guidance.

The sound quality and noise-cancellation are not worth the annoying user experience. Go with another reputable brand for headphones.","April 14, 2021"
Andrea,3,"The main issue is the touch controls on the headphones to pause, play, forward, backward, volume up & down. Maybe I have the touch of an angel and my finger tips do no register with these headphones... but, it does not register. I found myself standing there and eventually just tapping the phone like a drum to pause, and because the noice cancelling is so powerful you feel like you are about to tap out your ear drum. The film on the headphones is soft and velvet like... which is what I suspect could be the main issue.

I do love the silver color and the fit is more comfortable. But, I like to be handsfree at all times. I also don't want to stress that I'm going to miss a call because my phone isn't on me and I can't trust that the touchpad won't register me accepting the call.

I had the Sony WHXB900N for 1.5 years and I have absolutely no complaints. They fell in the toilet and sadly died. Decided to upgrade to the next version because I use my headphone religiously for business and personal use. The film outside the 900's touch control is different, it's a bit rougher and I liked the texture. My fingertip movement registered perfectly fine every time. However, I am not going back to the 900N, it's time for new tech that has stronger sound quality for calls, so I'm going to be shopping around like Goldilocks until I find the perfect fit.","December 16, 2021"
RWS Apogee,3,"I haven't had a set of over ear headphones in quite a while but I thought I'd give these a try based on the stellar reviews of the predecessor XM3 model. Packaging is nice. The instructions consist of a fold-out sheet with pictures only. If you're not up on all the latest technology icons, you'll probably wish for printed words. There is an additional instruction sheet in about 6-point font that's fairly useless. Initially, I easily paired the headphones with my Apple TV and was able to use them quickly. The next day I decided to download the app to get into the finer aspects of setup. The app prompted a software update and allowed me to play around with equalizer settings and noise cancelling. I highly recommend using the app in lieu of the cumbersome instructions. Sound quality is very subjective. You'll find reviewers who think these are the best ever and others not so much. I fall in to the second group. Sound is decent, but not anything that stands out relative to what I've used in the past. At this price point I guess I expected more. From a control standpoint, the right ear cup has a panel that you tap to start/pause music or calls, skip ahead or back, and swipe to make volume adjustments. I absolutely hate the volume adjustment. Each ""swipe"" is about a 10% adjustment, so if you want to quickly raise or lower volume, you have to make multiple swipes. And half the time the swipes don't register. If you aren't swiping perfectly up or down, you will skip the music forward or back. If you're using the headphones with a device that has its own volume control, I recommend going that route. It's much easier. Overall, I'd rate the headphones slightly above average for sound and slightly below for controls.","August 22, 2020"
Kieran,3,"I used the the Bose quiet comfort headphones for over 5 years, and when they died a couple of months ago I did some research and decided to try these since there was a good sale going on at the time. If you don't want to read this whole thing, just get the Bose ones, they are better overall and I will continue to buy them after these Sony ones die. First, the Bose headphones are a million times more comfortable. These headphones were incredibly uncomfortable when I first started wearing them, but that has gotten significantly better. The Sony headphones have a lot of cool features, like automatically pausing your music when you take off your headphones. However, I found that most of these features don't actually work, and instead make the headphones much more of a pain. For example, whenever I took my headphones off when they were connected to my laptop they would open iMusic, which I haven't used since like 2007, and there's no way to stop it from doing that. I even deleted iMusic and it still somehow did it. The biggest downside by far (mostly because Bose doesn't have this issue) is that there is no way to turn off the god awful voice that yells at you every time you connect or disconnect a device. With the Bose headphones you can turn this off in their app. Finally, there are the little things that I didn't like, like how they use a less common charging cord than Bose does, or that the battery doesn't last as long.
Overall, these are solid bluetooth headphones, but if you're going to spend $300 on headphones you should spend them on a pair of Bose quietcomfort instead of these.","March 19, 2021"
Kaye,3,"I had high hopes for this product, but was disappointed greatly.

TL;DR;
I would have bought a Beats noise-cancelling headphones instead if I knew the noise-cancelling would be like this and if I knew it would be a hassle to use on and between Apple devices.

PROS:

One good thing about this is the sound quality. Although there are pretty good ones out there with less cost for a better sound quality, but just without the noise cancellation feature.

I liked how clear I sound on the “wired” microphone.

CONS:

After a few weeks of using it, I am quite disappointed with the noise cancellation feature. It’s not as good as I expected it to be. It feels like a regular headphones that just muffles the noise.

When I am on call, the other end can’t hear me well when I am using the built-in microphone on the headphones. So, I had to use the wired one to be heard loudly and clearly.

I can’t make enough use of the 360 reality audio. There’s not enough quality content out there for it.

The fit of the headphones is definitely not for me. It keeps falling off my head after a few minutes. Is my head too small for this headphones or does everybody else experience this?

It’s a hassle to switch between iPhone and macbook. I always have to hold the power button to trigger the bluetooth pairing mode, otherwise, it won’t automatically connect.

Volume control is also a hassle because one slide upwards only adds “1” to the volume. So if I had to turn the volume up from 50 to 100 via the headphones, I’d have to slide upwards 50 times.","February 3, 2021"
Florin Andrei,3,"If you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass and not much else.

Advanced users could fix the bloated bass. It involves using a parametric EQ and a preset based on precise lab measurements. I did that, and after the EQ they sound very good.

Noise cancellation is very good. These headphones will remove most noise from the ambient. They are a tiny, tiny bit better than the previous model (XM3), but the difference can only be noticed if you have both headphones, and you switch quickly back and forth between them. Otherwise it's impossible to tell. I would say they are about the same if you're not very picky.

The XM4 has a major flaw IMO: the electronics themselves make a bit of noise. You can hear it in the pause between songs, it's called ""hiss"" noise because it does sound like an animal hissing. It's not loud, but in silence you can hear it. To me that's not acceptable for noise cancelling headphones. They ought to be dead silent on their own. The XM3 (the previous model) are indeed dead silent in between songs. Most people may not notice this; if you're a discerning user, then you will hear it.

They are very comfortable. I could wear them for hours without problems. Same for the previous model, which is almost identical.

The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily.

I actually returned the XM4 and kept my old XM3.","October 13, 2020"
John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.

Sound: A-
First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.

Noise cancelling: A-
When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.

Multipoint Bluetooth: F
This was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.

Comfort: A
Compared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.

Controls: B
I totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.

In-call: D
One thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.

Auto-mute: F
Sony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.

Miscellaneous:
I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.

Conclusion:
All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.","September 19, 2020"
Dennis,2,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.

I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.

The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.

But things quickly went downhill from there.

After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.

I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.

The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.

After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.

Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.

All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.

I'll be returning them.","August 21, 2020"
Miguel Ramirez,2,"I have used these headphones on a near daily basis, and they were good (not great) throughout its lifetime. Below, I've included my experience throughout my 3 years with these headphones before putting them in its grave.

Sound quality - 3 stars
- These are great headphones for daily music use, and you won't regret the purchase if this is the only thing you're after. However, when I compared them to Bose's 700, the sound quality seemed a bit worse. However, for those of us who aren't sound engineers, these are good enough. I'd highly recommend going to a store and trying them out before purchasing. These headphones are good for answering calls in a quiet place, I would not recommend taking calls outside if it's a little windy, inside a car while driving, or anywhere that is relatively noisy.

Noise cancellation - 4 stars
- I can't give these 5 stars because the technology isn't there yet for total noise cancellation and honestly, they should do us a service and call them limited frequency cancelling. First, for those of us not familiar with noise cancelling headphones, they will not cancel every sound. However, these work great when on an airplane and definitely worth the price if this is a big weighting factor in your decision. Moreover, these work well for office noise, it won't totally cancel your co-worker's conversation if they are close to you, but reduces it enough to make the experience a little better.

Comfort - 3.5 stars
- I think the cushion starts out fine then after about a year it'll start to noticeably wear down, flatten and become uncomfortable. Maybe not a big deal if you have a replacement handy.

Control - 1.5 stars
- The automatic voice notifications drives me nuts and it now I essentially take off the headphones before receiving those voice notifications. These notifications are the ""power on,"" ""bluetooth connected"" etc.. There's no way to disable them, and Sony has remained quiet on this despite people calling for an option to disable the voice notification. The iPhone app is atrocious at times, it won't even load and sometimes you'll have to wait a while for it to connect to the headphones. The hand gestures are decent, and infrequently hit or miss with the swipes.

Reliability - 2 stars
- The headphones worked great the first year. The second year was good enough since the padding started to breakdown. In the third year, the headphones began to randomly disconnect from devices from time-to-time. Finally, I now experience a frequent and unbearable high pitch sound on the right earcup and the sound quality has been degraded. I can still hear fine on the left earcup, but I'd classify these headphones as not usable anymore. For the $300+ price I paid, this was not the best investment.

TL;DR - If you want durable headphones, do not buy these. If you are going to buy these, I'd highly recommend trying them out in a store before committing.","August 25, 2023"
J. Churchill,2,"Positives:

I do believe these headphones have incredible noise cancelling technology. They manage to make virtually every low-pitched sound (train engines, washing machines, etc.) non-existent and seriously reduce the sound of high-pitched sounds like talking, loud typing, clapping, etc. I'm a bit familiar with what's behind ANC and I can see both the internal and external microphones on the unit. Having ANC tech that adapts to both is what adds to a lot of the cost in high-end ANC headphones. These are certainly state of the art in that respect.

I expected the audio quality to be more amazing. It really is no better than the iPhone's included headphones or even the very cheap (but highly rated) Panasonic earbuds. However, adding ANC to playing sound is a tradeoff. Other, cheaper ANC headphones are far worse and wind up fighting with the music instead of letting you enjoy it. It could be that Sony is simply balancing ANC with sound quality and it can't get better than it is.

30 hours of battery life is awesome. It's literally 10 times more than AirPods. The low battery life of Apple's devices is why I avoided them.

Negatives:

These headphones are big and clumsy. As light and padded they are, they are still large, uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour, and take up a lot of space in a backpack. This isn't really Sony's fault; all over-ear headphones are going to take up X amount of volume because of the size and location of human ears. But due their size and weight, I am finding myself more and more often just using my cheap wired earbuds, even when the Sonys are sitting right there on my desk and ready to go. Do I choose ANC and excellent sound, but pain and discomfort? Or good enough sound, no ANC, wires that don't let me walk around, but no pain? I think you can understand the dilemma.

The gesture-based controls are nearly useless. I have heard from others that they don't work outdoors on very cold days, but that's not my issue. I only used the headphones in a climate controlled house. The touch controls are simply cumbersome to use. Either they will not trigger when I want them to, so I have to try it several times before they work. They also trigger when I don't want them to, such as when I pull up the top of my hoodie, move them aside to redistribute the pressure pain caused by the pads, or raise my arms to stretch. I would really prefer physical buttons, or even a way to turn off the sensor.

The headphones cannot be used while charging. They cannot be turned on while plugged in, and if turned on when plugging in the power cable, they immediately turn off. This is surprising behavior considering that Sony located the power port on the right side facing down, where it is most conveniently hanging while plugged in and being worn. After all, if you were on an airplane and just wanted silence, but were running low on battery, wouldn't you want to plug it in so that you continue to have silence for the duration of your trip? My iPhone and Macbook pro continue to operate while plugged in and charging, as does another pair of noise-cancelling (corded) earbuds I use. I can't think of any charging device that does not do this, so I don't understand how this could have been missed.

Another annoyance is that when paired with a MacOS laptop, every time they activate after turning on, MacOS will automatically launch the Music app and begin playing the first song. By ""activate,"" this could mean moving aside the left headphone to speak with someone, then putting it right back on. The Mac will start playing music even when something else is playing sound, such as VLC playing a movie. There seems to be no reliable way to turn this off and it's incredibly annoying.

After nearly 20 years of Bluetooth technology development, I really expected something simple like headphones to be a smoother experience. Remember when you could just plug in the headphones to your phone when you take a call? Pairing these Sonys is a huge time-consuming headache. Just switching between my Mac and iPhone is a chore. It takes a long time to re-pair the headphones to a different device, even if you were hooked up to them earlier. If a call comes in, I need a good 30 seconds or longer before it the sound is established. I have missed calls because of this. To the caller, it sounds like I don't know how to use a phone. Yes, the headphones do work with a phone, and the other side hears me well. But due to this pairing delay, I just use the corded earbuds and not the Sonys.

To paraphrase Chase Jarvis, your best headphones are the ones you have with you... and start working as soon as you put them on, let you answer calls right away, don't interfere with your listening enjoyment, don't cause your head to hurt, etc. By that measure, $10 cabled earbuds are my best headphones, and these Sony headphones are down at the bottom of the list. Low tech easily wins over a kitchen sink of advanced features.","January 22, 2021"
Cormac Harper,2,"Love the app, touch panel, comfortability, battery life, and sound. The noise cancelling on road trips is amazing, same with on planes. There is an optimizing mode in app that does actually change if you are optimizing on ground versus in air and optimize again. It’s a very neat feature that I use both for air travel, and roads trips from NY to NC and re-adjust during the mountains.

Sadly I’ve gone through three sets of these headphones and am finally done. I bought these first on Amazon in 2021 which they lasted about 7 months before developing a nasty rattle. I then bought a set at Target as I still liked them. The ones I bought there, HAD THE RATTLE FROM OPEN. Returned those and have the current pair. These were bought in January 2022, and lasted until now late November 2023. They’ve developed the same rattle in the left ear that each other set had.

It’s very disappointing that Sony can’t seem to hammer down long term reliability. Sadly I won’t be buying another pair as I no longer can trust the brand. I want to think that the XM5’s won’t have the same issue, but I don’t trust the brand enough to back them anymore. I’ve heard Bose has a worse app interface, but if they last longer then I’m willing to take that loss.

That said, if these work anything greater than 2 years for you, they are excellent headphones. I hope they do.","November 25, 2023"
R Paq,2,"I'm currently using some mid performance JBL headphones, with no app, just paired with a bluetooth transmitter which sound absolutely great, but they clamp my head too tight. Equalization is done by the preamp, but I have no complaints about their sound quality.

My goal was to replace the JBL's with something more comfortable. And, I also wanted to upgrade my transmitter and headphone codec to something better than SBC.

The Sony paired up to my current transmitter using SBC with no issue but I immediately noticed there was very little treble. I looked inside the cups to see if there was an insert I needed to remove. Nope. I've had $20 headphones that performed better than these. I tried boosting the treble at the preamp, but it wasn't enough. Basically, these headphones don't do much over 4 or 5k in terms of frequency response.

So I installed the app on my Samsung Note 20 and paired them to the phone. By comparison to my JVC, and some other earbuds I own, the treble was also very poor. The helpful equalization guide in the software didn't work so I just adjusted manually adjusted the equalization running the treble all the way up. Nope, they just don't have enough top end range.

I never have to increase treble on any audio equipment I own and the JBL's have plenty of top end.

The app controls were also unfriendly and I never found any volume control buttons on the headset I tried the voice interruption feature and it did nothing. Noise reduction was basically just no ambient noise. You're supposed to be able to touch these headphones to adjust volume and tracks. Nope, that didn't work. These headphones missed the ""audio quality"" mark. I'm returning them and now I'm back to the drawing board again... Oh, they were comfortable.","September 11, 2023"
R Inskeep,2,"I haven't tried other noise-cancelling headphones for comparison, but the noise cancelling on these headphones is good. The audio quality seems fine but the bass is annoyingly loud at times; although I am not and do not pretend to be someone with a good ear for that kind of thing.

The reason I am writing a review is because in daily use these headphones unstoppably and predictably bombard the user with useless notifications. There is a setting to ""disable"" notifications but Sony in their infinite wisdom prevents the user from disabling ""important"" notifications, where ""important"" seems to refer to those notifications which provide information that can easily be obtained by means other than audio notifications.

First I would like to discuss the format of the notifications. Whatever audio the user might be listening to is turned down to the point of being nearly inaudible, but since it's still technically playing Sony feels no need to pause whatever you are listening to, so something like a podcast or audiobook will keep going, allowing you to miss part of it. Then there is a loud beep-y sound effect. Then a robot lady's voice explains, loudly and in ""polite"", complete sentences, whatever has just happened in headphone-land. Recall that these are noise-cancelling headphones, so between cancelling outside sounds and turning down the user's audio, every sound in the world but the notification has been made quiet, in addition to the notification being made loud. It is obnoxious to a degree which may be difficult to imagine without experiencing it multiple times every day for months. That the notifications are so predictable, for me, only adds an element of excruciating anticipation.

The foremost among these notifications are ""power on"", ""bluetooth device connected"", and ""bluetooth second device connected"", which for just $350 you could hear every single day for as long as your headphones last. There are also ""bluetooth device one disconnected"" and ""bluetooth device two disconnected"". These latter two may seem useful but they only trigger when the user intentionally engages in some action that would obviously result in that device being disconnected, such as clicking ""disconnect"" in the bluetooth menu or turning the device off. In situations where you may not know which device has disconnected, such as when the bluetooth connection cuts out or your computer crashes, you are finally spared from being informed about the nature of the problem by a notification which consists only of a synth instrument playing some kind of descending sound; the fact that this is the only situation where I have not been condescended to is part of what makes Sony's notion of ""important"" seem so surreal. And naturally, if the problem should happen to resolve itself, and you no longer have reason to worry about it, you will then be informed about the freshly-irrelevant details: ""(BEEP) bluetooth device two connected"".

The best you can do is let the headphones train you to use the ""pause"" gesture every time one of these notifications starts, which cuts off the notification. In fact this is the primary reason I personally use the pause gesture.

Interestingly, while googling for possible solutions, I learned that Sony has received a few complaints about the futility of ""disabling"" notifications on their forums, about which they have repeatedly pretended to care and in response to which they have never changed a thing. For this reason I am of the opinion that if you consider yourself in any way responsible as a consumer you mustn't purchase this product.","December 29, 2022"
Jason P,2,"TLDR: Barely functional at moments every day, severe connectivity issues, highly annoying issues, replacements/updates solved nothing, but the sound and audio cancellation is great. I would never consider recommending these to anyone.

For the last year I've dealt with horrible connectivity problems: Every 1-3 hours there are flurries of disconnecting and reconnecting bluetooth that last several minutes, interrupt my audio, and add many beeps. At least once a day, at power on, it will not connect to the bluetooth of any audio sources at all. Several times a week they will connect to bluetooth but not register as an audio device meaning I can't choose them as my audio output despite seeing them bluetooth connected.

For all connectivity problems I do the following until they connect: reboot several times, reset when that doesn't work, if none of that works then deleting and creating new bluetooth connections. Recently, it seems to me the problems appear more frequently when battery is below ~50%. I'm exploring that as a possibility now. I'd rather charge them more often if that reduces the frequency of these problems.

The problems didn't seem so bad or frequent the first few weeks but I may have just been enamored with the great audio and noise cancelling. I thought matters would improve (faulty thought process), so I didn't return them. At any price these are ridiculous problems to deal with multiple times every day much less for hundreds of dollars.

I'm on my 2nd pair after a warranty replacement because inserting the audio cable broke something inside which broke the noise cancelling. Warranty replacement was not smooth as Sony required uploading the proof of purchase to a site that would error out with every upload attempt regardless of which browser or OS. It took a few days, 2 claims, and one very helpful support person that agreed to let me email the receipt to work around the busted website.

My problems occur with all my audio sources: MacBook and iPhone 11 are my primary sources and at times with an iPad and Windows laptop. I use them 3-8 hours every day. I use the latest firmware which is supposed to at least address the frequent bluetooth drops (it didn't make any noticeable difference for me). The problems are no different with the the replacement headset received a few months ago.

2 stars instead of 1 because when they work the listening experience, comfort, and noise cancelling are amazing. I also love the transparency feature and that it's level of transparency can be adjusted with the app. Some of the features accessible through the app are difficult to use (for example, switching equalizer settings is done in a really bad way and is very slow). Other settings make the listening experience worse like trying to learn my locations to adjust the noise cancelling which really just causes audio interruptions in my audio and extra notifications as I move room to room (I think I was able to turn off notifications before giving up in the feature entirely). But the features that didn't resonate with me might be good for others.

I would never consider recommending these to anyone.

Edit: After 7 months some of the plastic and the hinges on both ear pieces have started to squeak like bad $50 headphones.

Ben,2,"I only wore these a couple times & i’m ready to return them. i have apple airpod max’s & I wanted to see if the sony xm4’s were better just to compare them.

The problem with this product is Sony wanted to add all these “cool techy” features & it just over complicates it. the sound quality is good & that’s the only reason i gave it 2 stars otherwise i wouldve just rated it a 1. while listening, the bass of the song youre listening to randomly gets quiet. i dont even know what to do on the headphones app to change this. too complicated & inconvenient. i will be returning this, & just continue to use my apple headphones. i wouldnt even pay $100 for this. $300 is extremely overpriced.","October 17, 2023"
M. Cordoba,2,"I can count on 1 hand the items I've returned. In fact, I don't recall returning any other electronic ever. I'm hoping this review will help some people.

I own the COWIN SE7 ANC (they go for around $100). Those got almost 6k review and 4.5 stars. So a well reviewed model, that costs less than 1/3 of these ones.
XM4s are better are virtually everything, but does not blow them out of the water on anything except potentially the ANC for voices or other random loud sounds. For air conditioner or other low frequency noises they are both great.
The one area where I like the COWN more is in comfort. I wear them for 5-8 hours a day.
The battery life despite both being rated 30 hours is definitely better on the COWIN. The COWIN I had to charge once a week, I didn't have to think about it, the SONY never lasted a week, always had to charge mid-week and then end of week. Yeah both had ANC on.
Despite all that I was going to keep the SONY, the app customization, the microphone quality is also a bit better, and especially the ANC for work from home made it worth it.

The Sony also have Bluetooth 5.0 (can connect to 2 devices at the same time) BUT...

Here is why I returned them. I own an iPhone and a MacBook Pro for work. I had had them connected to both.
Things that could be just a faulty product:
- one side would occasionally stopped sending audio. It didn't happen often but a few times during the month one side would have no audio, I would have to restart, connect back and forth until the audio finally came back. (this has never happened in my 2 years with the COWIN SE7)

Bugs / Issues with the Dual Pairing. (this was the main reason I returned)
- The headphones would pair a few times a day (2-3) to the wrong device and I had to fiddle with it for a several minutes each time to get it working again. One day it did this like 5 times and that was it for me. I returned them. Basically I'd open my phone and audio would play from the phone (great), then I'd lock my phone to return to the computer, and even though my phone had NO music playing, and the screen was locked, I could not get audio back to my laptop. So I had to fiddle with it for a few minutes to try and get it working. This became a daily hassle. So much that I stopped pairing it with the phone to avoid it, but the problem is in order to adjust ANC or music quality you need to pair it to the phone to use the Sony App. So I paired it to both again and the issue kept popping up. Sometimes it was the opposite. Sound would stay on laptop even though a call had come to the cellphone.

The other standout feature above the XM3 was the ear detection to pause/play when you put them on your neck (take them off your head). While this worked fine sometimes, it still was a problem enough times. Upon inspecting the issue, the sensor is deep in the ear cup. When you wear these for a long time the cushion gets wider and the sensor keeps detecting them as on, so taking them off the music would just keep playing... If I got the ear cup and moved it (pressed the cushion to get out of the way of the sensor) it would stop playing.

While I could've kept them, at that point I might as well save $120 and get the XM3s which are very similar. Since the dual pairing had so many issues, and the headphone detection (stop playing / resume playing) didn't work well, might as well save money and get the XM3s.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them.","September 21, 2020"
Randy Marathon,2,"I purchased noise canceling headphones to help dampen distracting noise while working at home. I did not intend to use them for phone calls, and indeed I have not ever tried to do so, so my review does not cover that feature. I tried the Bose QuietComfort 45, the Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II. I kept the QC 35IIs.

NOISE CANCELING
The QC 45 and Sony headphones do a much better job of canceling noise than does the QC 35II. If maximum noise cancelation is your foremost consideration above all else, get the QC 45s or Sonys. Their NC capabilities are comparable.

SOUND QUALITY
As others have noted, the QC 45s emphasize higher frequencies. The WH-1000XM4s emphasize lower frequencies but the sound is what I call muddy: It’s not that bass sounds better, it’s that all low frequencies are boosted into a murky mess. The QC 45s and Sonys are distractingly bad in sound quality. This is where the QC 35IIs shine, and why I selected them over the others. Music, across all frequencies, sounds very good. No frequency range is dominant, and I can actually hear individual instruments and voices. I don’t drink NA beer, I don’t drink decaffeinated coffee, and I don’t listen to music through crappy headphones. Although the NC of the QC 35IIs can’t hold a candle to the others, had I selected one of the others, I would have cursed myself every time I used them. The music quality of the QC 35IIs is that much better than the other two. And I know that sound quality can be objective and can depend on the individual user. FWIW, my evaluation occurred shortly after I began my seventh decade on this Earth. BTW, when using the audio cable with the QC 35IIs, I found the sound quality noticeably better with the NC shut off.

CONTROLS
Both QC models have physical buttons for volume and pause/un-pause, while the Sonys use various swipes on the right ear cover. As others have noted, each volume swipe on the Sonys adjusts the volume in a very small increment. It is annoying to have to swipe swipe swipe to make a volume adjustment, and that’s when the headphone actually recognizes it as a volume swipe. Double-tapping the Sonys to pause/un-pause works well, and is quick because you don’t have to feel around for the pause button like you do on the QCs. But I’ve come to terms with the microseconds I’ll lose over the lifetime of the headphones by having to fumble for the pause button on my QC 35IIs.

BATTERY LIFE
I didn’t keep the QC 45s and the Sonys long enough to determine battery life. I haven’t done a controlled study of battery life on the QC 35IIs, but based on my average daily usage, it’s got to be at least the 20 hours that are listed on Amazon.

CHARGING CABLE CONNECTOR
The QC 35IIs have a mini-USB connector, not the newer USB-C, but like the physical buttons, the microseconds I’ll lose by occasionally attempting to insert the charging cable incorrectly is something I’ve learned to accept.","March 20, 2022"
cincyshirm61,2,"I first bought the XM3's a few years ago for a cross country trip and was blown away by their performance in noise cancelling and sound quality. They were also very comfortable with great battery life. I returned them because I couldn't pair more than 1 Bluetooth device at a time. Can't listen to music or watch videos on my laptop and switch to a call on my phone like any pair of $50 headphones I've had in the past do easily. The XM4's came out claiming to support 8 simultaneous paired devices, so I bought them. They struggle with connecting to Windows 10/11 PC's and figuring out music vs talk. This may be Windows problem in part, recognizing 2 different drivers, but I've only ever had the issues I do with this headset. If I try to use an external mic with these headphones then I get no sound. Half the time I have to hardwire them so I don't miss calls. Incredibly frustrating and annoying but I've dealt with it.
Fast forward to now, the noise cancelling is failing. When I have it turned up all the way, the left earcup will randomly and very loudly start making whistling noises, some sort of sensor interference. It stops when I remove the ear cup from my head and starts when I put them back on. If I turn ANC down, this issue goes away, but I can't take advantage of the great noise cancelling anymore. So, Sony, I am very disappointed with how much money I spent on these to barely get a year of use before I again have to look for something new. I will not be buying the XM5's regardless of how good they probably are.","May 15, 2023"
Donnie Darko,2,"Very disappointed. Headphones checked all my boxes for price, design, weight, sound etc. I have an expensive, modern, recent Samsung TV however and although they connect via Bluetooth to the TV, the sound keeps cutting out and is not in sync. I will have to research alternative headphones again because of this. There’s no reason why these headphones should not work with a high end Samsung TV. I have multiple other, cheaper headphones that all connect perfectly to the TV. I will have to return these. What a disappointment and what a waste of time. 😔","December 9, 2023"
PB 360,2,"The interaction on these is really bad. They went for a fancy touch screen like feel instead of normal buttons. It really sucks, every time I touch my left ear watching a video it pauses it or ends a call. I cant take my headphones partially off when doing anything without it stopping a process on my phone.

Also they are already starting to make a clicky noise after a few months. I bought these because I had a pair of qc35s that lasted me 5years. I left the bose headphones out in the pouring rain WHILE THEY WERE ON and they still worked after drying despite them making a horrible ringing noise when they were wet.

Maybe you can get around this by covering up the little hole in the cup but for me, these headphones weren't good for the gym at all. Sound quality was good but lasting only a week and then not being able to charge wasn't for me.","November 15, 2023"
Som,2,"It was love at first sight and sound when I first got these headphones. The first few months were great. They worked perfectly, noise canceling was awesome, connected fine, and they were comfy. They are a bit odd to disconnect and then connect to a different device, but it was what it was. Unfortunately it wasn’t long before they started having connectivity issues. Can’t use them for too long before they turn off involuntarily, with a full charge. Or they just straight up disconnect for no reason, while in use. It happens enough that I now hate these headphones and wouldn’t recommend them for anyone with an iPhone or who plans to use them wirelessly. I expected a lot more from $200+ headphones and probably will never purchase any from Sony again.","September 25, 2023"
Tom,2,"I was really expecting a lot more after reading some reviews and watching YouTube videos. However I should know better that gadget Youtubers Really don’t understand Sound quality and are all impressed by how a gadget looks and non sound features. So I should start by saying over all these weren’t bad headphones. But they weren’t really great. Not enough to keep for the price. I had to return these. The biggest annoyance is the noise canceling works ok (Not quite as good as AirPod pro) But it has a really annoying tinny sound As if you just cover your ears with soup cans. Overall the sound quality is average and nothing spectacular. As far as consumer grade they are the same as other overpriced highly market headphones. but they don’t compare to anything high-end like sennheiser, Grado, Beyerdynamic akg or whatever. Bass is clean but not deep. Mid frequencies weak and buried deep. Vocals get lost and guitars have no sparkle or crispness. High frequencies are the same. Kind of not present. Soundstage is surprisingly narrow. You don’t have real good expensive sound and instruments placement is a bit lost. Luckily (and unfortunately) there is an app with an equalizer but it’s only five bands so you really can’t pull out the detail that’s lost and it only works on the device you’re using. So if you switched your computer sorry. The eq setting are in the app, not the headphone. While talking about the app I should mention that’s the main annoyance. There are some important features that have to be taken care of through the app. You have to tune the headphones which is annoying, and then there’s this really annoying feature where it changes a noise cancellation and will even turn it off and on automatically for you based on situations and locations. You can bypass this feature but unfortunately Sony updates their app every other day and it defaults back to being on So you have to go back to the app and disable it constantly. There’s a ton of other features in the opposite some people may think you’re great but I don’t wanna have to deal with an app when I’m with my headphones. Especially since I’m mostly listen on a computer Because iPhones can’t even utilize aptx which makes the sound bloated and flat on all Bluetooth five headphones that aren’t made by Apple (Because they turned them for aac) They are pretty comfortable and very light but they are dirt magnets being a matte black. They come with a nice sturdy case and proper accessories even for airlines which would’ve been nice. At the end of the day though there’s so little difference between these and a really nice pair of $70-$100 wireless anc headphones like sound ore or Wyze That they just aren’t needed for my particular use which would’ve been traveling. I find the AirPod pros I got from my job for free much more impressive. And when I’m really trying to enjoy music I listen to my Grados, or at50h.","July 18, 2021"
Virlaine,2,"Take away the brand and the reviews from the equation and I'll be brutally honest.

The noise cancellation is not bad but it's not otherworldly either and definitely in my honest opinion not worth that price tag. -moving on

The sound quality is mediocre, yes i've tried every equalization setting in the book and even used the spotify one and the sony app and even a third equalizer all together at one point as a desperate attempt to see what these people were hollering about. Stop the cap. >:(
These headphones right here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SHG4H92/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
side by side, are able to go toe to toe with these and they have a bass boost button on the headphone itself and blows the Sony's out of the water. (AND THESE SOUNDED BETTER WITH NO EQ SETTINGS ON AT ALL..)

Had my brother close his eyes and compare them side by side and he said the Anker sounded better. - and yea maybe those ankers are not as ""stylish"" and they leak a lot more sound, but they feel in terms of comfort and sound quality very similar (anker ones being more comfortable as my ears don't get hot like with the Sony's and i game with the ankers for long sessions so i know what im talking about. Put on the Sony's longer for 2 hours and your ears will get hot if you’re like me)

Build quality is pretty decent, it feels good in the hands, i feel Boujee holding these but again...buyers remorse is real.
They are very similar to those 45-50$ headphones I just linked and based on the reviews of these headphones breaking a lot and my own personal experience of dropping my Ankers like it's a routine I can confidently say I'm going with the Anker's on a drop test. Regardless, that's not the reason I think these are bad.

In terms of sound quality for the price you're paying , cheap gaming headphones in the 40-50$ price range should not make you question your purchase of a 300+ dollar headphone.
That should never happen, those cheap ass gaming headsets that i bought for 35$ on sale should not even com close to being able to rival these or imo even sound better than these (literally the bass is even more punchy and the highs and mids rival them)

But hey these look great on paper though...
Disappointed. You people are paying for research, style and brand which is understandable. The price is not justified, straight robbery. Sorry Sony. If the price was 90-120$ i would say that I'm impressed, but the higher the price goes the higher the expectations and these did not live up to them.

Returning

Edit: if you don't mind paying the extra 50 bucks , you might as well just grab these https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwyoutube07a-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B076X4KH11&linkId=74e19456f77529ecd54d5a0cd3959359

Gives sony a run for their money","September 4, 2021"
Jamie Hamel-Smith,2,"If creaking headphones bother you, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THESE.

With anything but loud music playing the headband and earpieces of these headphones creak like an old house. It is amplified through the ear-cups and is very distracting (more because of the $300 MSRP).

If you search online for ""xm4 creaking"" you'll see a lot of people complaining about this. Apparently the XM3 had this issue too, and the model before those as well. Sony just doesn't seem to care.

If you're thinking to yourself, ""how can this reviewer enjoy the sound of these headphones so much, but still want to get rid of them? Is the creaking that bad?"" - YES. These are active noise cancelling. Silence is the point of them, and the creaking constantly breaks the silence with whispers of cheap plastic.

Another gripe:
These headphones require you to manually disconnect from the currently connected device (either via the app or the phone's Bluetooth settings) before you can connect to another device.

Let me be clear. This is awful. If my tablet is in another room, or my bag and I want to connect the headphones to my phone... I then go to my phone's Bluetooth settings (where they are already paired), and touch to connect to them, and nothing. It spins, says ""connecting"" and then nothing happens. I've tried this on multiple devices and it just won't connect to a device if it's currently connected to another device. Contrast this with the Galaxy Buds+ which will allow you to be paired to 8 devices, and you can ""Connect"" from any of those devices and it will instantly connect the headphones to that device.

I'm really salty that none of the reviews from Linus Tech Tips, MKBHD, or the other YouTubers mentioned these quirks and issues. These headphones sound amazing; if you never move your jaw, move your head, or want to switch them to a second device. Once you do any of those aforementioned things, you're left wondering why you paid over $100 for them.

Edit:
I eventually contacted Sony about the creaking issue. They were helpful and have agreed to replace them. I'll update the review if the replacement set is any better.

Update:
The replacement Sony sent developed the same ""cheap plastic material sounding"" creaking noise after... 3 or 4 days; if I yawn, move my head, move my jaw; it creaks. I just can't recommend these; the sound of creaking plastic while listening to your favorite music with great active noise cancellation is the equivalent of someone farting in a quiet theater during a tender moment of the performance. It ruins the whole experience.","August 18, 2021"
Lilly F.,2,"The mids are muddy and it can't be fixed without a (non-Sony) paid subscription app. The EQ settings it comes with are awful, so you need a different app for that as well. The only music that sounds reasonably good on these is hip hop. If you only listen to hip hop, then buy these. For the life of me, I don't understand why these are so highly rated.","November 27, 2023"
aproductofsociety,2,"My experience with these headphones has been disappointing. First, I've been surprised by how much I hear when the noise cancelling feature is on at the highest setting. Even the rustling of fabric (and I'm not talking about velcro or something especially noisy) is audible through the noise cancellation. I'd call the effect ""gentle noise reduction"" -- the term ""noise cancellation"" is much too strong a characterization given the headphones' modest abilities in the noise arena.

To get the headphones to really cancel noise, I not only have to set the ""noise cancelling"" at maximum but play a white noise track on top of that. When I combine the two it's very effective, but it isn't noise cancelling at that point -- it's substituting a more desirable type of noise for a less desirable type of noise. So maybe Sony should call these ""Noise Substitution Headphones""?

Second, I've gotten many complaints from people when I've tried to have phone or video conversations with the noise cancellation feature on. They say they're having trouble hearing me, my voice is distorted or cuts out abruptly. Turning off the noise cancellation feature to have a conversation helps, but then I have to listen to the background noise I'm attempting to screen out. At that point, I might as well just take the headphones off entirely, so what's the point?

Also, if you touch the headphones to adjust them or take them off briefly, they will often initiate play on anything that could be played -- a track on your phone or computer, a Youtube video in a window you happen to have open. It's annoying, and touching the headphones in the same way does not turn the track off. You have to figure out where the track (whether phone or computer, and where) and then turn it off manually.

Lastly, the headphones disconnect from devices arbitrarily. You hear a few tones and then the synthetic voice tells you ""bluetooth device 1 disconnected"" shortly followed by ""bluetooth device 1 connected."" This happens without touching any equipment.... and not because you're far away from that equipment. Why?

I've no idea whether the other leading ""noise cancelling"" headphone contender from Bose suffers from these problems or not. But based on my experience with this Sony model I intend to give that Bose alternative a try.","January 11, 2022"
Aria Janke,2,"For nearly $400, I get modest noise cancellation for wireless headphones. It's very frustrating to me to invest so heavily in product which was intended to solve noise problems, only to find that the solution is far from complete. To make matters much worse, Sony out of nowhere has decided to start collecting data on their app users. A privacy violation which further devalues these headphones for me. Such violation renders the app unusable to me. I suppose it being wireless is nice.

I am very disappointed from the supposed ""best in the industry"".","October 17, 2023"
Meta,2,"I appreciate the sound quality and the noise cancellation of these headphones. I’ve had this for 10 months. Today, the left headphone was not sitting well on the ear. As these are expensive, I take good care of them, and store them in the carrying case. I saw a small piece of plastic has broken off at the swivel part.

Looking through the Amazon reviews, I see two pictures of the exact same issue. If you search the internet and the Sony community forum, and you’ll see thousands of people have experienced a crack at this area making the swivel part not work. I contacted Sony who then referred to their authorized repair place. They claim this is not covered by the warranty.

If thousands of people are having the same issue with normal, careful use within the warranty period - that suggests a manufacturing defect. I wish I had known about this because I can see that this is been an issue for years. Very disappointed that now I’ll have to figure out how to fix this issue myself at my expense.

Headphones at this price point should not have this quality issue experienced by so many people.","April 7, 2023"
Hank,2,"Great for about 2 years, then a hinge broke through normal wear and tear, a very common problem with these headphones. Sony support would not help and just gave me a number to their third party repair service in New York. I fixed the headphones myself for about $35 and 2 hours of my time.

A few weeks later, the headphones began making an unbearably loud sound when noise canceling was activated, so I could no longer use that feature. I've now learned this is yet another very common problem with these headphones.

I loved these when they worked, but I want to get more than 2 years out of headphones for what these cost. Sorry to say I'm done with Sony.","August 31, 2023"

TMonacelli,2,"I bought these a few months ago after reading many reviews calling this the best wireless headphones in this price range. The touted features; noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, excellent fit are all 100% true. They sound great, they will block out as much noise as you want them to and they are light and comfortable. With that said, I have struggled mightily against the terrible app. I use an android phone (Pixel 3a) so not sure if this is as terrible on the Apple side, but honestly, I have had some form of the same problem consistently- ""Cannot connect to WH-1000XM4"". Now, my phone (and anything else I want to connect these to) have absolutely connected. I can be listening to a podcast while trying to access the app and getting this message. The problem with not being able to use the app is there are some settings (namely the ""adaptive sound control"" feature that will pause your music anytime they hear you talking) that you will want to turn on and off as needed. If you can't access the app (which 95% of the time I have not been able to) then you can't access this feature. There are other features as well, like if your default setting is ""noise cancelling"" or ""ambient sound off"" which I would like to switch. Since I can't access the app, it's having to constantly manually update these.

If you are buying headphones and are fine with the default settings (i.e. these will always start in noise cancelling and the adaptive sound control will be on) then these are worthy headphones. If you want to use them in a variety of environments (for instance, I wore them shoveling and the adaptive sound control paused my sound every time the shovel scraped the ground- not great...) then this may be a deal breaker for you. One caveat here- I have not heard many other people complain about this- so maybe my version of android on my specific pixel model just doesn't work with the app (I was able in one of the rare times my app connected with the headphones to get the latest version of it- that has not solved this problem). Maybe I am just in an unlucky situation. My guess is that other people have experienced the same thing though. It would be fantastic if Sony gave us a desktop app to control these settings- or better yet, had advanced touch controls that let you change any of these features. I would be happy to edit or remove this negative review if I am overlooking these things.","January 26, 2021"
Herbert Sauro,2,"I’ve had these headphones for a while now. The sounds and noise canceling are ok but two issues really annoy me. I use zoom a lot and I’ve stopped using these headphones for zoom for two reasons:

1. The Microphone is terrible for zoom calls. People hear a garbled sound at the other end especially when the connection isn’t 100%. The iPad microphone works fine under these conditions.

2. Connection to Bluetooth is hit and miss. The first thing is you must install their app otherwise the headphones won’t connect to the device at all. Second, on my iPhone and iPad making a connection doesn’t always work. On the iPad 9 or 10 times will connect but the iPhone is much more difficult to make a connection.","August 3, 2023"
Trent Guillory,2,"Don't even start to analyze the audio quality of these before you hear about all the non-audio issues that ruin this thing...

Full review:

These headphones have okay audio, but their connection is so spotty and the system status messages so annoying that it ruins the experience.

Every time the connection status of any connected device changes - even one that isn't actively playing audio - the headphones say ""Bluetooth device 1 disconnected.... Bluetooth device 1 reconnected""

When I turn these things on in the morning for work, each device triggers two of these alerts. Then, randomly throughout the day, they continue to happen.

It's so frustrating because I'll be in a zoom meeting using these headphones, and my iPhone will decide to disconnect - this shouldn't be a problem - I'm using my Mac for the meeting, which is what is streaming audio to the headphones at the moment. But Sony doesn't care. The headphones duck my Mac audio and play two loud messages ""Device one disconnected (1 sec pause) Device one reconnected""

That may seem like a short message, but you can't hear anything else while it's going. And if it sounds rare, it's also not... this whole interrupted meeting thing has happened so many times.

I've gone through the settings and read the Reddit forums - I can't disable these messages for the life of me. I wish I could make my phone forget the headphones, but the headphones need a phone connection for all their settings.

Oh and I almost forgot one last thing - there's this weird chime that I haven't quite figured out. I have no idea what the chime means, but it too will come in out of nowhere, is often played twice in a row, and also just blocks out any audio coming in.

JMW,2,"These would get 5 stars from me, except for one thing that makes them not anywhere near 5 stars...
I love everything about these headphones... the sound is amazing, noise-canceling is top-notch, calls from noisy rooms come across clearer than any other phones I've tried...
But they have one incredibly annoying feature. You can't turn off the ""voice notifications"" for certain ""important"" notifications. Every call I pick up on the headphones, the phones chime in to say ""device 2 has been disconnected"" at an annoyingly loud volume... so loud that you can't hear the other person talking because you've already answered the phone call. You can't turn off this notification. It makes for an incredibly bad user experience. And while it may see like a small thing... if you're using these and taking calls multiple times a day, it gets incredibly annoying real quick to have to ask the caller to repeat what they said at the beginning of every call.
This notification could be easily changed to a chime instead of a voice... that would at least be a more user friendly notification.
Additionally, this has been noted to Sony in several places, by many users... and they haven't responded except to say that you can turn off some notifications... you just can't turn off ""important"" notifications.
End of the day, I love these headphones... but this one incredibly annoying feature will cause me to happily spend $100s more on an inferior Apple product rather than have to deal with this STUPID voice on every phone call. Unless this feature is changed, I'm NEVER buying Sony headphones again.","August 11, 2022"
Fiona,2,"Worked great for 3 years, best headphones I have ever owned. Now whenever the noise cancelling is on there is horrible popping sounds and painful pressure changes to the ears.

Diana H.,2,"I've had a pair of Boltune over-ear headphones for a long time and they do a fabulous job of cancelling out all outside noise. The faux leather is starting to fall apart, though, so I purchased these Sony headphones to replace them. Wow, how disappointing. The only pro I really see is the sound quality is pretty decent (and I like the equalizer in the app). But they certainly do not eliminate ambient noise very well (yes, I flipped through the 3 settings and the noise cancelling one is just insufficient for the price). I wore them on a plane and while it was somewhat quieter, I could still hear the plane noise and the people around me. My Boltunes almost completely knocked out that kind of noise on the plane. Maybe I just got a lemon, who knows.

Also, I primarily wear my headphones in bed so I can have the volume as loud as I want and not worry about disturbing a neighbor (apartments). These Sony headphones are definitely not good if you want to lay on anything. The noise was either constantly cutting in and out, or the audio track would fall behind the actual TV (which was maybe 8 feet away). I never once had that issue with my Boltunes. I even tried to make sure the pillow wasn't touching the sides (since that's where the touch controls are), but then it was uncomfortable so what's the point.

Overall, I do not recommend these if you are looking for something that blocks out ambient noise and/or you want to use them in bed.","August 13, 2022"
Wonder,2,"Regarding the Bose NC700 and the Sony WH-1000XM4 noise-cancelling headphones:

Both have good noise-cancelling.

The Bose has more control over the noise-cancelling and ambient sound levels. The Sony has more auto-adjustment.

If you wear glasses or anything similar with the Bose, you lose several steps of the noise-cancelling; glasses have no impact on the Sony's sound quality.

Contrary to its claims, the Sony canNOT handle being connected to more than one device at a time, unless you mean to use one device for listening to audio and then have your phone be absolute primary and override every time. Bose can switch back and forth between two devices, not flawlessly, though fairly usably.

They could BOTH learn a thing or ten from Logitech, and add an additional button for device switching, and another additional button so we can use voice-assistance as advertised without having to be WITHOUT one feature or the other.

If you want to be able to use a voice assistant you will have NO control over ambient/noise-cancelling levels on your Sony, unless you have your phone and Sony app open in front of you all the time. That essentially means you can have basic noise-cancelling/ambient control OR you can have voice assistance. Inane.

The Sony likes to make noise at EVERYTHING, beeping and talking loudly in your ear to tell you whenever it has turned on, whenever it is turning off, whenever it connects to bluetooth, whenever it's changing volume, whenever ANYTHING. There is no option to stop this. The Bose can be asked to be more subtle and decent, and is elegant about this. Sony likes to turn on ""Speak-to-Chat"" ""feature""(torture) and no matter how much to you turn it OFF in the app, it will turn back on through accidental touch on the headphones. It's impressively horrible.

My limited experience with Sony's customer support so far has been that they don't care about the customer and their results. Btw don't email them, apparently they only will actually help via chat--according to them; they offer email just to have an official channel to waste our time and energy. My repeated experience with Bose's customer support is that they are consistently ultimately sincere in striving to resolve issues for the customer.","October 27, 2020"
Amazon Customer,2,"For the first two weeks, I loved these headphones. Great sound quality and the noise cancellation was excellent. BUT, on the third week a loud, distorted, swooshing wind-type sound started coming from the headphones when I had it in noise cancellation mode. It would start approximately 30 minutes of having it on. It did this every time I wore them for a week until I finally had enough and decided to return them. They are too pricey to have such an issue after only three weeks of having them. Will order the Bose noise-cancellation headphones instead.","August 9, 2023"
D. Holmer,2,"I didn't feel like upgrading my TV in order to use my bluetooth atpx transmitter with this headset. Seriously, no aptx support at this price point? The comparable Bose Ultra headset does support aptx as do several other cheaper brands.","October 19, 2023"
Michael Friedl,2,"My sony headphones lasted about a year and a half before the noise canceling just... broke. Another two months after that they started making a high-pitched squealing sound every time the non-existent noise canceling was turned on. Also, the left touchpad stopped functioning reliably and the right one broke entirely around that time as well.

A friend of mine also owns a pair of M4s that he's owned for 3+ years and besides feeling far sturdier than mine they've also never had any issues which makes me wonder if Sony cheapened their design at some point.

I did buy these at a discount but that's still a lot of money to spend on headphones that couldn't make it two years with light use. I occasionally took these to the gym but most of the time when I wasn't wearing them they were resting on top of my home computer. The knife was twisted recently as my Sony M4 earbuds also stopped working... after eight months.

G. Fenu,2,"I bought this because my computer built-in microphone can sound too faint for other folks on my Teams calls. However, the headset is not very good for work calls. The microphone is very good, however it picks up ALL ambient sounds, even very low ones. That means other people on the call can hear your mouse clicks, breathing etc. There may be a way to dampen the sensitivity of the microphone but I have not found one. The headset can use an app to change settings, although the app is only available on phones (android or IOS) so you need to waste one the the two bluetooth connections the headset can maintain on your phone. I was hoping to use it with two PCs. Finally, while the range on the headset is great - I was able to maintain a connection to my PC from several rooms away - the headset has NO mute button. You must be at your computer to mute/unmute through whatever conference app you are using. That makes the headset unviable for conferencing while doing other things around the house.

Jason B. Davis,2,"I've been pretty loyal to the XM lineup for about 5 years now. Every once in a while I'm dumb enough to lose them somewhere or they get stolen, so I might upgrade to the next or skip a generation. The last one I had was the XM3. I was excited, since I thought it was a no brainer that the Xm4 would be even better. Logically that tracks, right? After having these for about 6 months though, I really wish I could get my money back. I can't speak to specifics of high or low frequencies and all that audiophile nerd stuff, but overall without a doubt these are substantially worse at noise cancelling than the last was, and it's very frustrating. The XM3s were a DREAM--I didn't hear a damn thing. With these XM4s, I can make out entire sentences of conversation when the volume is at a medium level. In fact, the only time I can shut out noise is if I bump the volume level almost all the way up, and I can shut the outside world out with max volume with any pair of headphones, ANC or not, so what's the point? The only upgrade from the XM3 is these cushions seem a little more comfortable. Overall, I can't believe Sony called these an upgrade.

Jordan N. Elleby,2,"Pros:
- Excellent at blocking sounds and especially voices. it makes it feel like my wife sitting next to me is a room over.
- good sound quality
- good battery life
- Bluetooth is rock solid with no noticeable interference or white noise
-the features related to walking settings etc… sometimes you don’t want the world class noise canceling but these settings are awesome!

Room for improvement:
- comfort, these are not able to be worn in my opinion for an entire workday. Further there is no comfortable way to remove one cup off of one ear.
- case form factor is just awkward
- the two devices simultaneous connection is an awesome feature that has no way of selecting which device to use… so sometimes you need to actually disconnect with one to listen to another… what’s the point again? Oh yeah 2 devices connected.

Cons (absolutely horrible features):
- the custom burton has no customization… you know what would be great - if I could switch connections with the custom button… nope you can ONLY select the smart listening platform
-the touch controls are constantly making calls on your behalf, pausing/playing/activating thing you don’t intend. I had to turn them off.
- In the current age is it honestly too much to ask for the headphones to STILL WORK while charging…. This one feature almost had me give the headphones a 1 star… why in the hell can I not use them while they’re plugged in. This is a non-starter for 90% of wireless devices because it disables your ability to use headphones while they’re charging when you NEED HEADPHONES. I’ve had to start carrying two sets of headphones for when this dies….

Steve,2,"These are great headphones - when they work, which for me has been infrequently across 2 different pairs (especially the mic).

I got these headphones just over a year ago (for working from home). They worked well for a couple of months and then I started having people report that my voice had an occasional robotic blip a couple times per meeting. It was minor enough to not have to discontinue using them and just deal with it for a while, but after repeated attempts to fix it (firmware installs and reinstalls on computer and headphones, online forums etc.) and the problem not going away, I called customer service (they heard the same blip during our call) and got a new pair.

They sent me a new pair with little hassle. So far, this was a set of faulty headphones with good customer service.

Then, my new set of headphones I've been using for about 6 months. This pair immediately seems to have weaker bluetooth connection (I used to be able to go 20-30 feet to the kitchen without the old pair disconnecting, now they disconnect ~50% of the time when I do this). However, other than that, it was fine. Now, about 6 months later, they microphone just straight up broke. Rather than a robotic blip, my voice sounds like I'm underwater 100% of the time. I now just use them as noise cancelling headphones but can't use them for meetings, the reason I bought them.

Reading up, it sounds like good bluetooth microphones are hard to come by. Whatever you do, don't buy this pair for that purpose.","April 25, 2022"
A,2,"I've had three pairs of ANC headphones now, two MPOW brand, and these.

The active noise cancelling on these are good, but they cannot deal with wind noise despite having a setting for it; you will hear buffeting and grating sounds created by these in windy scenarios. They aren't the best for bumpy vehicles as there are ""pressure waves"" as best as I can describe that actually hurt my ears and I have to turn the noise cancellation function down, even after ""optimization."" The MPOW doesn't offer the same level of cancellation but also doesn't have these issues.

The call quality is crap, frankly. Any sort of background noise will be transmitted as clearly as your voice. Like the road or engine noise of a car, for instance. Or wind. Honestly, the MPOW isn't far behind this in call quality, it cancels out more noises but sounds more muffled in the process.

They haven't been able to pair with either of my Windows 10 PCs, but pair perfectly fine with my phone. To be fair the MPOW struggles here too, but at least they show up in the bluetooth list.

There is an audible hissing noise when using the included audio cord and no audio playing on the device which doesn't seem to be irritating at first but after an hour or so it becomes quite distracting to the point where I'd rather not wear them. Like constant radio static playing in the room next to you.

It comes with the smallest USB-C charging cable I've ever seen and for the price range that's pretty unacceptable, the MPOW's came with a cable twice as long.

The audio quality is decent but it isn't WORLDS better than the MPOW Deep Bass ANC headset, it's clearer and crisper but seem to perform similarly when ANC is active.

Build quality isn't much better than the cheapo MPOWs either, to my surprise.

Honestly, these are a rip off. They're maybe 10-15% better than the cheaper alternatives for 10x the price.","February 7, 2021"
Crystal,2,"Was a great product until it suddenly malfunctioned about a week or so ago. The noise cancelling feature is now unusable. Disappointing as this has occurred right out of the warranty. I'm not sure if I will be buying this again since it is 2 years old and suddenly rendered useless.

Was great while it worked.","September 17, 2023"
JWeldon,2,"Idk man, I’ve ordered two of these and had issues with both. It could certainly be an issue with the Amazon behind the scenes seller but both had issues. The first pair wouldn’t ever reenter Bluetooth pairing mode and would not factory reset (wild you need to hit the power button for these because it just turns the headset off in my experience). The second pair connects to Bluetooth on my computer but it’s so dang scratchy I end up connecting with the provided wire anyways and they don’t charge while connected with that wire so they die within a day as well. Just overall very mehhhhh headphones to be $300+. The soundproof is actually crazy good so that’s the only reason for not a 1 star rating.","July 1, 2023"
Amazonguy123,2,"I had an amazing impression upon first getting these headphones, and i had used them almost 6+ hrs a day for gaming. I had a friend recommend these to me and we both shared the same impression.

There's a problem mentioned in a few reviews here and if you search them on the web that the earphones will occasionally just become faulty and start to pop or make static noises while 'ambient sound control' is enabled on the headphone. In my case, it started as popping and would eventually become a loud shrill noise. I became pretty scared to wear them directly on my ear as i don't want to live the rest of my life deaf in one ear.

This particular headphone is very susceptible to moisture damage for some reason so if you ever get moist ears while working out or just being in a warm enough room it's entirely possible for your headset to be ruined this way too. Both my friend and I ran into this problem, but his got wrecked from use while working out, and mine was just average use while in a hot room.

I contacted warranty for a replacement and will continue to use the headphones while taking much more care to this kind of issue but I would not recommend these headphones because at an almost 400 dollar price point you would think these headphones would not have this kind of problem. The audio quality takes a large enough hit that simply using the headphone with Ambient Sound Control off is noticeably worse.","May 15, 2022"
harvey Rhama,2,"These WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones are very annoying for a couple reasons. I’ve been using them for almost a year. First, volume changing demands many hand swipes to affect even a small decibel change- like trying to prevent a mosquito from flying in your ear. Also linking and pairing is far from obvious or consistent. Switching from my phone to desktop takes over a minute of multiple maneuvers. But the most upsetting, annoying, and probably impressive to some is the beep, bong, pop, clank, and ding in your ear you get if you attempt any mode or alteration to the listening process. If you change volume, you'll receive a loud clank with each increment increase or decrease (and it takes many swipes ten to twenty). I don’t need a audile warning alert to tell me I just changed sound level! I prefer to hear my music unimpeded by Sony. The fact that I can’t turn this “feature” off is just stupid. The fact that it exists is stupid. The uncontrollable and much ‘louder than the music’ volume of these alert sounds/warnings? just adds to the distasteful experience of using these things.
The app controls are adequate and the sound quality is good and relatively controllable. Also, they pause and restart your music/content by just removing and replacing from your head- very nice feature. I just can’t wait for them to break so I can justify a new set of different headphones without the persistent Bing, pop, clink, clang.","July 3, 2022"
Art,2,"Very comfortable headphones that sound reasonably good. All the positive review online are accurate. Functionally Id say that the microphone and call quality are the only notably bad parts of this headphone.

But the ANC is fantastic. Or at least it used to be.

I had these for about a year and a half. A few weeks ago the left ear cup made a big screeching feedback noise when I put it on. It hurt my ears quite a bit. It does this every time I put the head phones on. After some tinkering I realized it was the ANC. It needs to detect the sound around you to cancel it out. Something's gone wrong and it thinks there is a very loud sound it needs to cancel, and now its squealing at a hearing damaging level. If you run into this problem you can turn Ambient Sound to ""1"" the lowest level and it seems to prevent the squealing.

The warranty is only one year so I'm out of luck. I am annoyed by this because I'm fairly certain this was a firmware update that they made through their app that caused this issue. So it feels like I had a working pair of headphones, Sony bricked it with a poor firmware update, and now I'm out of warranty and out of luck. I cannot confirm this however because you cannot rollback to previous firmware versions.

Sony support wasn't much help when they said it was out of warranty. They redirected me to some 3rd party repair company. They didn't even forward them details about my case, just gave me a number to do it myself. Pretty lame for a $350 headset.","January 26, 2022"
LCH,2,"Too tight:
Comparing to my old Sony MDR-XB950BT are so tight they cause sweating.

Sound isn't professional-tier, barely prosumer:
Can't hear much of a difference between these and my old Sony MDR-XB950BT. Bass boost on the old Sony MDR-XB950BT is better (not that I would use Bass Boost personally).

No charger:
At this price point no included charger and included cable is laughably short.

No bluetooth base, not a good general handsfree headset:
My Poly (Plantronics/Polycom) Savi 8220 has over double the range of these. The Savi includes its own ""base"" and its bluetooth between the headset and the Poly W8200B base is so much better at keeping the wireless connection good. The bluetooth between a current iphone (iphone 12), android (pixel 5), macbook, pc laptop and pc workstation has long delays leading to kung-fu movie like lip issues which do not exist on the Poly Savi. Sony needs to get with the program and get a bluetooth base they include to help eliminate these ridiculous delays on bluetooth. Poly did this. Not sure what Sony's problem is.

Requires phone-app:
There should be software for a real computer (and not these terrible crippled phones and tablets) (eg, macos, windows and linux) that lets the user control the headset configuration. Poly has this as well.

""High res"" audio and Audio 360:
High res doesnt work with Multi-connect. Audio 360 requires third party sound sources. LDAC is disabled (its laughably short range) if multi connect is used.

Spying headphones?:
These should include an explicit way to disable the spying Google Assistant and Alexa. It still shows up if you aren't using it as a device node in the device manager - scary to think these spying programs cant be disabled explicitly.

Old review: Noise cancellation was amazing, bass was awesome, BUT the controls...........they suck! you touch them and sound goes off, music pauses, I'm still trying to figure it out.....Sony messed this up, but I sill like them a lot, they are just a pita to use.
I can deal with them responding to errant ""touches"", but when nothing is near them, they still drop our frequently.........I'm getting frustrated and angry now. Reduced from 5 stars to 3 stars! hope there is an update or go around. I need something I can rely on.

T. J. Barlow,2,"I bought these during a sale. I have a pair of Bose QC 35 II I've used heavily for 5 years. I honestly preferred them to the Sony. The sound was about the same, maybe slightly better. A few features were cool, like the detection of off ear, but overall they were extremely uncomfortable for me after only a short time of use. I instead ordered the Bose 700 and I am a fan. Sounds so much better and feel very comfortable. I gave Sony a try, but I'll stay with Bose from now on.","July 14, 2023"
Eric,2,"I really wanted to like these, but it seems like a poorly designed product. The sound quality is fine, I don't feel like a lot of these headphones sound amazing out of the box. The experience is just incredibly frustrating.

For how much these cost, I expect the user experience to be much better than it is. Everything must be done through the app. Switching between devices must be done through the app, on your phone. Pairing to a new one, go back to your phone and open this app that I would rather forget exists. Its a small thing that gets really inconvenient, I feel like I should be able to at least easily pair to new devices without needing my phone. The charge it holds, I don't know if I got a defective unit, but it does not hold a charge as well as stated. And the quick charge seems to only be a thing when using an adapter that supports fast charging, which is not included and is not stated clearly on the product page. Don't expect to benefit from that feature if you don't have one of those, I actually don't and while I wasn't surprised, it was a let down to realize one of the best features is completely useless with just the equipment in the box.

The last thing, and this may be a personal pet peeve of mine, but the low battery warning is insanely aggressive and is honestly the last straw that is making me want to return these. I probably will. Having a voice yell at me every 30-60 seconds when I'm still at 20% battery is insane, and there's no way I can find to turn it off.

Overall, really disappointed with these. Got them to replace some aging wired over ear headphones that I've had for quite a while, and they have been a huge let down.","March 21, 2021"

royal,2,"I bought the XM4 to replace my QC35s and they worked well and I preferred to use them for better noise cancellation and preferred the sound from the Sony headphones as well. Unfortunately both headphones have experienced technical issues, but my Bose headphones not turning off is far better than my Sonys producing a deafening sound forcing me to take them off. They're just garbage now.

Pros:
1)Active Noise Cancellation - very nice ANC thats highly adjustable and accessible, although i find the button having 3 settings to be a bit annoying since 2 of them are essentially the same.
2)Comfort - can wear for hours, lost comfort as pads wore down.
3)Customizations provided through app

Cons:

1)Eventually started making a loud squeeling noise making them unusable.
2)TOUCH SENSITIVITY - everyone say it's bad, I ignored them, I should have listened... My shoulder braising it through a t-shirt, or hair on a pillow will set it off. Suddenly all the accessibility through the touch features creates all kinds of random problems for you. I guess it forces you to learn the gestures so you can undo them constantly. Imagine watching a show and you lean over brush the headphones and it just jumps to the next episode. Spoiler potential isn't quite as high as the annoyance factor but just an example.
3)unable to find good replacement for the ear pads/cushions. Never had that problem with my Bose headphones.","May 27, 2022"
Wayne or Lanell,2,"Let me explain. I am an audiophile, music enthusiast..., you get the picture. To me, sound is pretty much everything, with comfort and build quality (how long the product will last) also being important. Hours upon hours of research online led me to those beautiful pieces of art. 9/10 of the websites I visited had these at the #1 spot so I placed my order. When I got the package, I headed straight for the instructions, read what i needed to know, and carefully pulled out the pair of cans. The design, as I have said before, is beautiful. As I tried them on, I noticed how incredibly light and comfy they were. The moment I turned them on, the noise cancelling kicked in, and, o wow, the world really does fall away. Now, the moment I've been waiting for. I plug them into my phone, turn my phone down to protect my ears (haha), and play ""I Like Me Better"" by Lauv. First reaction: OWW. The treble is flat out painful. So then, I connect the headphones to my phone over bluetooth and set them up within the app, taking pictures of my ears..., (Yes it customized the NC and music to your ears, which is kinda cool.) I prefer a wired connection, because I listen to FLAC music files (CD quality music) and bluetooth degrades that quality. But, I tried it anyway to see how it would go. The app was pretty simple to use, and finally, I found it, the eq. I turned down the treble a little and pressed play on the song. It sounded aweful. I put the eq back to flat and it sounded exceptional quality-wise, but still piercing. The moment I turned down the treble again, music dropped out and turned back on, sounding really bad. I scrolled down in the app and found out that to use the eq, it lowers the quality, and noticeably. I was done. These were returned the next day.","September 26, 2020"
Anthony S.,2,"I had previously purchased the WH-1000XM3, which lasted about 2 years before the charging port actually MELTED in normal charging conditions. This should've been a ""wake-up"" call. but I went ahead and ordered the latest model of the WH-1000XM4 headphones. I purchased these FEB 5, 2021, ran through charging TWICE with them, and on the third attempt the charging port stopped working. (NOTE: the USB-C cable provided is no more than 4"" long, rendering it useless, and they do NOT provide a charging cable/block with the phones. Follow instructions on recharging CAREFULLY or you may void the warranty ). Thankfully I had registered the product with Sony immediately after purchase and chose the extended warranty that was available, because this expedited the return procedure. I contacted Sony customer support and have been sent a RETURN shipping label, have shipped the WH-1000XM4 back and am hoping the next pair have no issues.

The WH-1000XM4 model phones are in fact ""better"" than the WH-1000XM3 version if you are using Mac iOS, now enabling you to connect to 2 devices at once - nice feature. Insofar as sound quality, I couldn't detect enough of a difference to say the newer model was superior over the older model, but the game changer for me was the 2 device feature. Syncing the phones to multiple devices was easy, over-the-ear comfort value: good, so for the money, a good buy. I ""hope"" this USB-C charging issue will be resolved. If It is not resolved, I will in fact post another updated review. I am expecting the new phones in 10 days, depending on weather. My advice is if you can afford a better brand, buy them. This price point worked for me, but if the new ones don't work, I will look for a better brand of over-the-ear phones.","February 18, 2021"
Alex Turner,2,"I like this product as a vacation pair of headphones. They have good noise cancelling, are pretty comfortable, and hold a good charge. They're nice on a plane, in an airport, in a hotel room. The sound quality and depth is really great, the bass reproduction feels very nice, and I enjoy music on these headphones.

Less good is the general feature set. The touch controls are a disaster, and the auto-on/off feature when you take the headphones on and off is a complete pain. I wish there was an option in the app when you first connect to enable or disable this feature set. This makes these headphones totally useless for day-to-day usage in the time of Covid. Sometimes I need to take one ear off to hear the environment around me, which may or may not cause music to start playing in the middle of a meeting. The auto-off feature is great for battery saving when you're on vacation, but in a work environment; it means that the headphones frequently don't re-connect quickly when jumping on a meeting, which is embarrassing. These headphones are okay for a few hours of usage, but after 4-5 hours, they start to get uncomfortable, which, given I'm on work calls all day means they aren't good for work usage again.

The online reviews that laud these headphones aren't wrong - the sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent; but those paper cut features that just annoy you are the death of these headphones, and so for that reason, at this price point, they get just 2 stars and I find myself going back to my older Bose headphones 90% of the time, to a point that I may just buy a new pair of Bose to replace the Sonys.","March 4, 2021"
Diamond Neil’s Kitchen,2,"After the XM3’s I returned due to inconsistent Bluetooth connection to my TV, I settled for an off brand that did the job but lacked the awesome Sony ANC. After a few months, I decided to try these XM4’s and enjoyed the fast Bluetooth pairing, great sound & awesome ANC. Unfortunately, after a few days of use, the Bluetooth audio became very “crackly”, like a bad connection or when a speaker is blown. It was in both ears and I tried to reconnect many times, turn off all other devices, etc. but nothing worked.

I chatted Directly with Sony Support and after confirming I had the latest update version, he had me power it off then hold the “power” & “custom” buttons down for about 7 seconds until the Blue light blinks 5 times and goes out. He said it resets the configuration which could be the problem. I connected again to my TV and the sound was crystal clear. When I went to use them again later that day, the crackly sound was back. Also, the Audio delay was extremely out of sync and the swiping features would freeze at times and we’re in the mid 70’s here so not cold.
After all this hassle I will be retuning these nearly $400 headphones, I was better off with the off brand $30 pair and am going to just deal with the average ANC.
XM4 Pros:
Style is great.
Comfortable after hours of use.
Has an excellent app to get your preferred sound.

Cons (All of this happened in less than a week of purchasing):
Bluetooth connection poor to my 2017 Samsung Smart TV.
Bluetooth would randomly disconnect or go out of sync with video.
Swiping functions would freeze up and would have to restart & reconnect despite being in warm weather.
Short charging cable.

BloodOfJesus,2,"Pros
1. Good sound quality
2. Light weight
3. Good Bluetooth range
4. Soft paddings on ears and head areas
5. Good battery life

Now the Cons
1. Could be a little cheaper maybe like $100 less
2. Can get warm or sweaty in ears area
3. Now this is the worst part. The noise cancelation will damage your ears. I mean when u wear it when off u can hear some external noise but when turned on there is something that feels like small pressure that makes you not hear or barely hear anything from outside. This leaves some kind of a weird effect on your ear eg you might hear a sound in your ears after usage. Not sure if this can be long term or cause damage. Since my return window closed, I now wear it just half way over my ear so I do not cover my ear with that pressure or whatever. Wish I had returned.
4. The apps to maximize sound quality are expensive. The headphones are expensive enough. No one wants to deal with an extra subscription
5. Would not recommend","November 12, 2022"
S.Er,2,"Initially, I loved these headphones. However, like many other reviewers, I began having issues several months after the 1yr warranty period ended. I began noticing a weird pressure differential between the two ears, and then the right earphone began ringing loudly. This appears to be a feedback issue caused by the failing noise cancelling microphone.

Fortunately for Sony, this issue seems to crop up after the 1yr warranty period ends (for me, it began at 18 months). Despite this being a known and very well documented issue, Sony will not honor any kind of service or replacement for the headphones.

If you buy these excellent headphones, just make sure to CYA and get a 3-year warranty plan to go with them.","May 22, 2023"

Brian C. Kesler,2,"The only great thing about these are the sound quality. If you’re only listening to music then great. I use them mostly for watching movies and the experience is pretty bad. First of all, it takes a while between the film or video starting before the sound kicks in and when it does it is usually very crackly and I have to pause or start over to get the sound to come out clear. This is the same across devices and televisions. Second, there is a HUGE latency issue. If watching a movie in 24p, which is preferred, the sound will start out synced and slowly pull out of sync until I have to pause and restart to get the sound to line up again (which usually starts the crackling issue back up, therefore having to pause and restart multiple times). If watching with the factory frame rate setting, the sync is permanently just slightly behind, just enough to be noticeable and irritating. The only feature on the devices is to further delay the sound, but there’s no way to really match the two. I’ve tried removing all special audio features such as Atmos and EQ, but the latency persists. The touch features are also irritating, as is the voice command feature. The only time I thoroughly enjoy these headphones is when listening to music, but then again often the beginning of a song is cut due to a delay in the audio kicking in. I almost prefer my old skull candy headphones which my dog chewed on and have lower sound quality to these, if only to be able to watch a movie with synced sound.","May 8, 2021"
Nella Mann,2,"I have had the XM4 version for about a year. They work well indoors and on an airplane, where the environment is already (fairly) quiet.

I have them linked to my iphone by bluetooth so that I can listen to music while mowing. What a joke. Noise cancelling turns off randomly with no notification, bluetooth deactivates randomly with no notification, and the ‘option’ button that supposedly can cycle through ‘ambient sound on’ ‘ambient sound off’ ‘noise cancelling on’ does nothing - unless in frustration I long-press, and some stupid ‘optimizer’ kicks in. When it occasionally decides to work, it is great; the mower sounds disappear and the music is loud and clear. Then two steps later, it is gone again. I must look a right idiot, spending more time fiddling with these things instead of mowing.

I have deactivated as many of the smart features as I can to try to eliminate location and speech issues; to no avail. The app is poorly designed, with conflicting options and no clarity. Just let me turn on bluetooth and noise cancelling - and KEEP THEM ON!

Awful high-pitched feedback noise and whirring noise due to the noise cancellation features malfunctioning or something. Faulty design due to moisture getting trapped from what I've heard? Did a factory reset, cleaned the ear cups and internals as thoroughly as I could and still the problem persists. Contacted customer service and they wanted to have me send them to a third party and pay for the repair myself. Laughable for one of the hallmark brands of the audio industry. My advice is to look for something that preferably has a little more longevity. Planned obsolescence like this is genuinely ruining technology as it stands.","May 10, 2023"

inowhatevaseline,2,"I bought these headphones based on the recommendation from a friend who swears these are the best thing Sony has ever created. I needed noise canceling because my Mom keeps the TV extra loud, and I can’t concentrate doing my work with that noise. I’ve been using AirPod pros and they are great w/filtering out excess noise, but after awhile, my ears hurt while wearing them. So I wanted to try over the ear headphones to see if I could get great noise canceling while also more comfortable to wear. I was truly disappointed! I don’t see how these are considered noise canceling since I can still hear most things pretty well. I walked outside with them and still I can hear birds even when noise canceling on. I don’t hear birds chirping with the AirPods at all. As far as listening to music, these headphones work fine. When taking a call, it takes several seconds to connect to the phone after you have answered the call. It’s annoying and the caller on the other end is wondering why you can’t hear them! Sometimes the headphones just power off while I’m using them even though they have more than 50% of power left! It’s ridiculous! My friend thinks I’ve received a defective pair since she has had none of these issues, but I can’t return them so I’m stuck with $300 headphones that are practically useless to me.

Amazon Customer,2,"Sad to say that after less than a month of owning these they no longer turn on. I attempted to charge, trouble shoot but to no avail. They seem to turn on at random and when they are on they appear to be fully charged. I bought these during the Prime day sale and was super excited to own a pair of quality headphones for music listening, movie watching and also for work calls as I work from home. I was really disappointed that they hardly lasted, also they are not very good for voice calls. I played with the ambient mode in an attempt to make it easier to hear myself when I talk but the ambient mode is finicky and mostly works with music. The ambient mode also has a mind of its own and turns on even after I have turned it off. I am hoping I just got a defective pair? I did notice though that there is at times a soft high pitched ringing which would take my attention and enjoyment away from the music I was listening to. If it wasn’t for all of these issues it would be a solid pair of headphones as the noise cancellation was amazing even without having music or sound playing. Hopefully others have a better experience.","August 8, 2022"
Kindle Customer,2,"While I found the sound was good - these headphones weren't perfect. For instance, the speak-to-chat was annoying because it kept turning on after being turned off.
The biggest thing is it broke by the hinge (there are other reviews with pics on here) and this isn't covered under Sony's warranty. Sony claims that this isn't a known issue, but reviews on here show otherwise. These headphones weren't dropped and mostly rested on my desk. I wouldn't waste my money as the quality just isn't there.","June 16, 2023"
Wiley Greenway,2,"WH-1000XM4 deserves credit where it's due. The headset offers the best audio I've experienced from a pair of headphones. The noise cancelling is quite good. Repetitive sounds like white noise will generally disappear. However, sounds like doors closing, dishes clanking or foot steps are just mildly faded.

The reason I'm giving the headphones 2 stars is they lack extremely basic functionality. What the headphones can do:
Using phone: Audio ✓
Using phone: Audio + mic ✓
Using PC: Audio ✓
Using PC: Audio + Microphone.... Nope!!!!!
There is no way you can use the headphones with normal audio while using the microphone on your computer! Which you know, might be useful if you want to be on a chat channel while gaming, doing a call while in an application that has audio, in an online meeting and have a presentation with audio, etc. You might be asking, surely one of the following options fixes the issue:
Wired connection: Nope!!! Only supports audio.
Bluetooth dongle to support the needed bandwidth: Nope! Not supported by WH-1000XM4
Updated bluetooth drivers: Nope...
Research for support because surely you must be missing something. Using audio + mic is basic functionality: Nope!
There is nothing you can do to fix the issue. WH-1000XM4 simply isn't designed to support audio and mic on anything but extremely low resolution mono audio (if you force your device to use the channel). You'll run into endless excuses from Sony if you research the problem.
#1: Sony, admit the lack of extremely basic functionality up front
#2: Put an actual wired connection or dongle support if you have to! But seriously, the headset can simultaneously be connected to two devices but you can't use audio + mic?!?","December 8, 2020"
Nate R.,2,"UPDATE - RETURNED: Sony's offer to ""resolve my issue"" was an empty waste of my time. Upon contacting them, they simply reiterated, ""Our Level 2 support told you this was working as designed."" Muppets.

They ignored and failed to address another issue, which was the total malfunction of the Quick Attention Mode, where you place your hand over the right ear cup and it pauses and goes to ambient. Didn't work from day 1, and no firmware update resolved it. Reeeeeeeeeturned them suckas.
--------------------------------
Noticed that anytime the mics were active, either in a standard phone call or a VOIP call on a laptop, the noise cancelling took a noticeable step back. All ambient noise became much more noticeable. After playing with the NC modes, I feel it's not quite the same as ""sound control off"" - it seems to be blocking certain frequencies? But NC is noticeably reduced, whichever frequencies aside.

Spoke to Sony Level 2 support (which was responsive) and they indicated this is working as designed. The device borrows mics from NC to bring in voice so noise cancelling can't operate fully when the mics are being used. (He also tried to tell me that if it maintained full NC, my voice would be blocked out for the other side - I'll chock that up to ignorance blended with desperation.)

I can understand if the NC was less precise with fewer mics listening, but dropping the intensity of the NC noticeably? Ya?

My Gen 1s from 2017 give me full noise cancelling during calls. This is a big step back.

The pro reviews are singing this thing's praises universally - this is a huge miss IMHO. (And I'm not even going to mention problems with the Android app.)

Probably sending them back. So disappointed.","August 24, 2020"
Tyler,2,"While on a phone cal the Noise Cancelation ONLY works for the person wearing the headphones. If you're on a phone call, the end user will hear a pin drop from across the room. FORGET about trying to wear these and be on a phone call and doing anything else (typing on a keyboard - walking in 2mph wind - washing dishes). I was washing dishes and my mom thought I was playing in the ocean. The mic totally amplifies everything!!!

These are comfortable though. I love wearing them. Sound quality is also amazing. The headphones do block out all other noises when you are listening to music, which is cool because you don't have to have the volume cranked. You can adjust the noise cancelation affect to also listen to ambient noises or to hear the lady whispering to her husband about how bad his farts stink, from 4-5 seats down.

In summary, these are great for only music. Garbage for phones calls. 1 star in Noise cancelation because I bought these as a primary means for multitasking. It totally sucks that when I'm on the phone and typing that my boss is mad because it sounds like I'm in the middle of a thunderstorm.","February 17, 2022"
bythecshore,2,"My first pair of these that I purchased in Feb '22 would go from ""Battery full"" to ""Battery at 30%"" with no in-between steps. I got them replaced under warranty and the new pair is worse, it goes from 100% to ""almost empty"" with no in-between steps.

I only use these for plug-in listening - no bluetooth, Alexa, etc., so my use case is as simple as it gets. It's very annoying to have them suddenly out of power. I don't think I'll return them again as they'll probably just send someone else's return.

I'd stay away from these based on my 100% defective experience. Too bad, because otherwise they were just what I needed, but without reliable battery reporting they are almost worthless to me. (I use them for meditation and having low-battery alerts come on while meditating it very disruptive.)

Update: I did return the 2nd set and got a 3rd under warranty. It has the same problem!!! I must be doing some weird thing that messes them up. They are plugged in using the included 1/8"" cord to a cd player all the time, so maybe that's somehow draining the power? Who knows, but I""ll likely sell these and get a Bose pair.","June 14, 2022"
Isaac Davidson,2,"These are good headphones with good noise cancellation. However, for me both these and the XM3s have had an awful rattling in one side of the headphones whenever the noise cancelling is on (after checking online this seems to be a common issue). I've been trying to contact support about this for month but I have never gotten their website to work (due to issues on their end) and they've never responded to any messages. This is frankly unacceptable for how expensive these are.","June 11, 2023"
Sabrina L.,2,i might return these because the sound is good don’t get me wrong but it’s not as loud as i was hoping and the noise cancellation isn’t very good i downloaded the app and still i hear everything around me they are very light and the case is nice but noise cancellation is a very important factor for me.,"August 3, 2023"
Teresa Yee,2,"After using them for close to 2 years I started having an issue with the noise cancelling, it would feedback with itself and overcompensate by making a high pitch noise, it happened while I was wearing them and was very painful, had hearing issues for a couple of days. Buyer beware.
That issue aside, they have great sound quality and the noise cancelling is decent. Bass is a bit too strong for my taste","July 18, 2023"
Neal O'Horo,2,"I really want to like these. 5/5, the noise cancellation works great. 5/5, the calls seem good. 4/5, the volume control is pretty easy albeit a little hokey. 3/5, they're somewhat comfortable for my big head but start to hurt after 30 minutes. 5/5, the battery life seems long lasting. 0/5, the two device control is awful. One device control works well. They easily connect to my iPhone X. For the 2nd device, when I connect to my Mac, however, the main audio stays with my Mac, and I cannot switch back to the iPhone. Certainly, the Sony audio app gives an indication that the headphones attempt to switch back to the iPhone, as the primary device, and then the headphones immediately switch back to my Mac, even with every audio and video app shutdown on my Mac. In fact, the only way I can switch back to my iPhone is to disconnect the Bluetooth from my Mac. I imagine Sony can fix this with a firmware update which brings me to the next issue, firmware upgrades. Soon after pairing my iPhone to the headphones in the app--the initial pairing in the app failed until I forced the issue in the iPhone Bluetooth settings, by the way--the app attempted to update the headphone firmware. When this happened, it stopped at 2%. Much later, after switching between apps, returning to the Sony app, I saw the firmware update process stopped. It was only when I checked the version, did I see that the firmware update works. I would avoid purchasing these until Sony works out the kinks with some firmware upgrades.","August 27, 2020"
Amazon Customer,2,"Giant caveat regarding this review: I am not a typical user. If you are a road warrior in need of absolute silence on an airplane, receive many calls a day, or just generally like the latest techno wizardry, take this review with a grain of salt. I wanted the option to do what I just described, but manly wanted very good audio and foolproof functionality. Here's what I found after a day of use.
1. While the noise cancelling is extremely good, there is a hiss that is easily detectable when no music is playing (and slightly so during quiet passages).
2. While watching a movie late at night while my better half was asleep, the audio dropped out twice. I was about 15' from my AVR. When the audio came back the first time it was really delayed and required shutting down everything, bringing all components back up and then restarting the movie.
3. The other problem while watching a movie was that the Bluetooth codec supported by my AVR caused a huge amount of delay. I had to manually set the the audio delay in my AVR configuration to 0, and then still had a tiny bit of delay in the audio compared to the video.
4. Audio quality is inferior using Bluetooth. I found myself using the included wired connection.
5. The touch controls were inoperable. I had to use the app to control volume, etc.
6. This headset generates a lot of heat. My ears got uncomfortably warm.","May 17, 2021"
Jeremy Chone,2,"I used bose for 15 years, bought this one thinking it was a time to change. What a mistake.

The biggest issue is the microphone in online meeting, and I assume phone as well, terrible. Everybody could not hear me well for a week, I thought it was something else, until I really narrow it down to those headsets. My old QC35II worked great, AirPod Pod worked great, laptop mic worked better, the voice on this one was terrible.

Then, I did some research (too late), and basically many reported the same issue with the Bluetooth and apparently need to buy another dongle, and I am not even sure it will work. Also, I have the latest Macbook 16"", so, not sure why I need to buy a Bluetooth adapter for this headset while other always worked.

Also, some features are nice, but other are annoying. When in a call, audio change time to time, kind of tricky to find which setting to turn off while keeping the NC. Also, no way to turn off the voice assistant completely off, always have the voice, ""one device connected"" ""second device connected."" I would have loved to be in the product management meeting where it was decided that the user should not be able to turn those voices off (you can turn some off, but not completely)

Anyway, but I wasted $350 on this, I will probably buy the Bose 700 at some point.

On positive note, the sound is good, and some features are good as well. Just wish they would have try to match Bose on the call side.","October 2, 2020"
Josh,2,"Noise cancellation is hit and miss. Unfortunately it amplifies a lot of sounds to painful levels to the point I have to turn it off most of the time. For example, an A/C vent near me causes a painful, high pitched noise in the left ear.

Also, it resets every time it turns off, so you have to re-disable ANC. So pain squared

Touch panel is usually great, however if you rest your head against something slightly conductive, it starts triggering random commands like triggering Siri, changing random settings on accessible in the app usually or jacking the volume up to max. Fun fact, I’ve learned there are a lot more conductive fabrics than I thought.

Sound quality is some of the best I’ve heard in a Bluetooth set, and EQ profiles in the app are a nice touch.

Being able to connect to multiple devices is fantastic, however switching between devices needs some software work. It’s a pain to switch and 80% of the time it shows disconnected in the app until you explicit hit ‘connect’ even if you are playing music from your phone!???

Also battery life isn’t as great as I hoped, usually only get 12-15 hours before an abrupt F U message plays and the headphones turn off

Don’t know if they are worth the price, hoping Sony makes something a little more polished next time. Don’t make me buy yet another Apple device

Lastly I didn’t know silver was some sort of weird beige color","February 6, 2021"
Digitalartguy,2,"They were refurbished and I was under the impression they got the extended warranty refurbished products tend to get, but apparently not. I dropped them one day from my computer desk, about 3 feet. The first drop I can recall since buying these and it left the hinge damaged. No reply back from manufacturer about replacement/repair and the cost of the parts to self repair is very expensive. They were fine up until they showed me how flimsy and they are for almost $400 headphones","May 20, 2023"
b on c,2,"Unfortunately, you should avoid these cheap quality headphones at all costs.

Matt W.,2,"I did a lot of research and most were great, so I chose this over the Bose. That was a mistake, I gave this a shot for a month, and although the sound is good...and the NC amazing, these headphones are FULL of bugs: I can list them all here but it wont make too much sense if you don't have the app so I will be very high level:

1) Dual device setup, which is a great feature does not work seamlessly. It often plays your PC when you want Phone or vice versa.
2) Sony Headphone App overrides all other Apps that use sound so its a constant battle to get it to play sound in an app of your choosing.

Between these two issues alone you are constantly having to connect and disconnect and switch on and off phone or computer apps to get the things to PLAY WHAT YOU WANT. Its really infuriating.

Also:
3) Routinely disconnects at random, then immediately reconnects.
4) Fancy Ambient sound control is a bunch of fancy uselessness.
5) Touch sensor control panel: HORRIBLE DESIGN. When you try to increase/decrease volume it often changes tracks. Or does not work at all. Or mutes. Please Sony, go back to Physical Buttons. This concept in practice sucks.
6) I wear glasses and they hurt my ears/head after extended wear.","May 26, 2021"
R. Santiago,2,"After much debate and analysis between this Sony model and the competitor Bose, I decided upon the Sony WH-1000XM4. Decision was based on reviews of music bass quality. Although I had issues with Sony headsets in the past, reviews on this one were very good.

I was pleasantly surprised by the headset and noise cancelling works really well…providing it works. What I mean by that is that I found one very annoying issue with the headset. With the headset linked via Bluetooth, I get chimes when an email arrives…to be expected and can be turned off. However, every time there is a new email chime, the noise cancellation turns off. Yes, still linked and function as headset…but the noise cancellation is disabled until another email comes in and chimes again. Then it re-engages. I get over 100 emails a day at work. Having the noise cancellation flip on/off 50 times a day is very annoying and defeats the purpose of the headset for that.

I found a quick fix is to just turn them off/on…but problem returns upon the arrival of the next email and chime. Even after the software updates…issue remains.

I regret this purchase and should have stuck with Bose or my 3rd option. Will never buy Sony headsets again.

I do no recommend this headset.","May 18, 2021"
Dave Coleman,2,"Genuinely love these headphohes. Light, comfortable, travel well, great for gaming and movies. They fit on my head, and don't fall/slide off like Bose 700s.

About a week ago, the left ear started piercing feedback whenever I turn on Noise Cancelling. I have updated firmware and app, cleaned all accessible areas. Feedback doesn't stop. I can use the headphones as non-noise cancelling, but that's not why I bought these. However, out of warranty I think (bought Oct 2020). I suspect it's something related to ear cap foam degradation with use. Maybe I can fix it by replacing the foam.

So, great product, but you'll have to buy another pair every 2 years unless they solve this problem in production, so budget accordingly.","December 15, 2022"
Vikrant Singh Badwal,2,"Noise cancelling has been the bane of this headphone's existence. Early on the earphones from the left ear would crackle followed by a sound that I would describe as howling wind every once in a while. Now both earcups emit very high pitch noise whenever the noise cancelling feature fails. Sometimes it gets SO loud that makes me wonder if I am going to have hearing damage. Support services pointed me to an outside repair house who didn't find anything. I did a little research and tried to do the cleaning and adjusting; which helps. None of these solutions are permanent. Sony really let me down on this one.

These headphones sound great when they are functioning correctly; however, the noise cancelling feature doesn't work well when I am listening to music. I can hear things happening in the background especially if the volume changes drastically. The response is pretty slow.

I would not buy these again and I don't think that they are worth repairing anymore. So be aware.","September 19, 2022"
Matt V.,2,"I own both Bose QC35 II and WH-1000XM4. I can say hands down the Bose is more user friendly, multipoint works properly, and it is a breeze to switch Bluetooth devices. Not so with the Sony. Noise cancellation is better and the sound quality is excellent, but the Bose are more comfortable and more user friendly. The sound quality on the Bose is excellent. Sony more or less requires you to install an app to access the full functionality of the headphones, which is really annoying, especially if you don't have a device that allows you to install an app (e.g. corporate managed cell phone). Also, some people just don't want to deal with an app draining their battery and spying on them, feeding data to the mothership all the time.

If I had to do it again, I'd get a second QC35 II.

Edit: Updating this review and lowering from 3 stars to 2 stars. Headset does not work with calling apps on Android, e.g. WhatsApp. Bose works flawlessly. Also, switching among paired devices is not possible without the Sony app. You need to disconnect connected devices in the app, and you can't easy cycle through paired devices.
I couldn't make this stuff up. It is hard to believe Sony is charging more for these headphones. Knowing what I know now, I would be willing to pay no more than $100 for them.","December 4, 2020"
Customer since 1999,2,"The sound quality of the Sony WH-1000XM4 is superb, but it feels like like the headphones are slowly squeezing my brain out of my skull.

The issue is not the size of the XM4s, it's the clamping force. They squeeze my ears too tight, even after I extended the headset all the way. I couldn't wear them for more than 20 minutes. It's been 30 minutes that I've removed them and I can still feel the pressure around my ears.

Most people with small or normal-sized heads will love the XM4s. The noise reduction is excellent and the sound quality too. But I have a big head there is no way that I could wear these for an extended period of time.

I returned the Sony WH-1000XM4 and purchased the Bose QuietComfort 45. The Bose QC 45 is way more comfortable than the Sony, I am very pleased with the change.","December 8, 2022"

Kelton smith,2,"Was in the market for headphones I can wear at the gym comfortably and found these on sale so I said screw it. I have the in-ear buds made by Sony and the sound quality was amazing so I figured these would be 10x better since they’re 4x the price. Guess that’s not how it works anymore? The in-ear ones I have (specifically the WF-XB700) honestly sound better. There’s more bass, I can get the volume louder, and the music doesn’t sound so far away. Don’t get me wrong, the features of these headphones are pretty cool, but definitely do not warrant the price tag. Should’ve went with the Bose ones I was debating on instead smh

Update: bought these august 6th, 2021. As of May 7th, 2022, they no longer work. Battery will not take a charge no matter what I do. Have followed all steps, have tried all available options on their website, with nothing changing. Next step is to call support in hopes they can help, but I don’t have my hopes up with how major companies go about customer service nowadays. I’ll update again when I do call, but as of right now, I am HIGHLY dissatisfied with these $300 headphones. Ridiculous","August 22, 2021"
Aaron J,2,"Update (01/25/21 after 2 months): I kept my second pair they were not bad out-of-the box, but not great. They have great NC, but are super noisy in quiet rooms. Not as comfortable, higher ambient noise level in NC mode, and slow to connect compared to XM3. All Sony’s will fail eventually from excessive white noise. If you are a 6-12h/day user, look elsewhere.

I’ll keep it brief. I wear headphones 12+h / day 365 days per year.
XM4 second pair (on my head now) p sound like a couple of styrofoam cups everytime I move my head, but they work. The n/c compensation is irritating
XM4 first pair - Returned my first pair immediately- wind-level noise. Terrible
XM3 - My second pair were great. Except the touch controls never worked. Got a solid year out of then. Still using them
XM3 - first pair heavy white noise (wind) out of one cup in a week returned
XM2 - second pair - slowly went bad. Constant low-level White nothing as bad as my XM4. I still use them in the yard
XM2 - 1st pair. After about a month, the wind showed up. Sony said it could be my hotel (in Tokyo). Was never able to fix. Tossed them.

Aaron S.,2,"The headphones are not bad especially if you get it on sale it’s worth it. However the use of non labeled touch pads in place of physical buttons flaws this headphone drastically. I’m not a tech nerd guy who uses his tech meticulously, I bump into things and I lay down with my headphones on, the touchpad is difficult and very sensitive, except for the volume which glitches slowly. If your someone who watches a lot of YouTube this is not the headphone for you, the touch pads randomly skip videos if ur within a centimeter of it, it’s annoying. The custom button is always randomly clicked on changing all my settings midway through a YouTube video. The transition from noise cancelling to non noise cancelling works smoothly about 20% of the time and the touchpad is basically invisible, I barely know the layout of the touchpad especially with the headphones on; even if you get to know the touchpad the sensitivity makes it difficult to use. I know some car companies that have switched back to physical buttons from touch pads and I see why. You cannot have anything near the touchpads (your hand, a pillow, hat, etc.) or the headphone will just be a nuisance. This is a 2 star headphone because of the terrible touchpad.","June 26, 2021"
Amazon Customer,2,"I’m a mild audiophile, and always try to seek out the best headphones I can afford.
Prior to these, I used a pair of Senheisser wireless headphones that were around $100. I used them for 3 years and never had a problem with them once. But I wanted to upgrade to something a little higher end, and I’d heard nothing but widespread acclaim for the WH-1000XM4s. Perhaps I should’ve looked into them more closely before purchasing them.
When they arrived, they sounded incredible right out of the box, and blew my previous pair of Senheissers out of the water in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation. But almost 3 months later… they sound kinda crummy. There’s a consistent static/rattling noise in the left earcup when I listen to music. Also, whenever I speak, there’s static crackling from the noise cancellation trying to cancel out my voice. (This doesn’t go away when I turn off noise cancellation) It completely ruins the listening experience. Apparently this isn’t an uncommon complaint/issue with the WH-1000XM4s.
So yeah, I’d love to give these 5 stars. They deserved them when I first got them, but I lowered my rating because this needs to be brought up, and other potential buyers need to be aware of this defect.","July 27, 2021"
Bill Boivin,2,"The Pros: Decent sound quality, and great noise canceling.

The Neutrals: they aren't over-ear, full-stop. Unless you have tiny ears, they sit on your ears. They have a system built in to notice when you take them off, and they will pause whatever music or video you are listening to. To me, it has been more of an annoyance than benefit; as even just re-adjusting them from time to time as you do, causes YouTube and whatever else to pause. The amount of times you have to un-pause stuff starts to become a pet peeve.

The Cons: max volume level was a let down; I find myself often trying to turn up the volume while listening to good music, only to find the volume is all the way up. It may be loud enough for some, but for almost $300, I was expecting more. Speaking of expecting more; the bass is just ""meh."" Fine for rock and stuff, but if you listen to EDM, rap, or anything else with heavy bass lines, you'll find yourself wanting more.

Summary: For being someone that loves some dirty metalstep, I found the bass and volume just lacking for what I want, and the on-ear fit (despite being advertised as over-ear, which is why I bought them), I find to be uncomfortable. I would not buy again.","March 21, 2021"
Caveat Emptor,2,"Good noise cancelation and sound quality but I'm getting rid of them and buying a different brand. First, the connectivity isn't good at all. There is major interference in even a slightly trafficked area.

The biggest problem for me, however, is that the touch sensor controls are impossible. While this feature adds to the sleek design, they make the headphones all but unusable. The touch sensors require tapping or swiping in different ways on the right cap of the headphones. Even once one learns the different hand gestures needed to operate the controls, it is easy to hit the wrong control. For example, you pause by tapping the center but volume control and changing tracks require you to swipe from the center outward in different directions. The headphones constantly register the start of the swipe as pausing the music. But the absolute worst is that there is a significant delay between a tap/swipe and the headphones responding. Between the temperamental controls and the lag time, the headphones are simply too frustrating to use.","February 21, 2022"
Ashley,2,"I wish I read the top review for these headphones before buying, but I was persuaded by a close friend to give them a shot. I agree with everything in the top review, even the headaches caused by these headphones. After 6 hours it's just irritating and I have to take them off to give my head a break. I tried them for a month but just couldn't adjust.

I've also had the Bose QC35 headphones for 4.5 years and still love them even though the battery life isn't as good as when I first bought them since I use them all day every day at work. I'm going to keep using my Bose headphones since:
- I think the sound profile is actually better surprisingly, even after fiddling with the equalizer quite a bit in the Sony app.
- I don't get headaches with the Bose QC35s, even after a long (10 hour) workday
- the Bose QC35s block/cancel more sound including muffling people talking more, which is really important to me to focus on work while other people are on the phone/taking conference calls nearby.

I ended up giving these headphones to my fiancé who appreciates them much more even though he has the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones.

Overall, these headphones were not worth the money in my opinion, even with the Black Friday sale.","January 22, 2021"

The left earcup housing broke today (on Black Friday 2021 too, lol), and I've had these pair for ONLY about 11 months. For this price I expected much MUCH better durability! :/ See pics for reference.

I dont know if this is related to the hardware issues posted in EDIT 1 below. The original Review was 4 stars. now its down to 1. Sigh.

Probably I'm NOT going to buy these back again now. Might go for the Bose Quit Comfort ones... Which sucks, I loved most of the UX of these while they worked.

EDIT/UPDATE:
*************************

After more than 6 months, a few issues have cropped up:

1. Sometimes, the touch interface controls dont respond at all - the volume or skip forward/back for several seconds and then it comes back. When this happens, sometimes the little beep is there and sometimes not, but in either case, the actual volume or skip action doesnt get performed. This is not a thing that happens with my $25 earphones ever on the same exact devices.

2. Sometimes it randomly disconnects from my PC or phone for a few seconds and then almost immediately reconnects. Its intermittent and hopefully, it wont keep happening. Havent found a common circumstance.

3. The Speak-to-chat randomly re-enables itself even though I have it permanently disabled via the app. Super annoying to have to disable it every few weeks.

4. The volume beeps and the ""Your device is connected/disconnected"" audio notifs are QUITE annoying and there's no way to permanently turn them off. Thanks Sony! Now whenever I move out of range of my phone/tablet/PC and it gets disconnected and then reconnected (which is frequent for my office use), I have to listen to those annoying messages EVERY SINGLE TIME!! Super annoying. Many have requested this feature in forums, but Sony doesnt respond, because who cares!

All these annoyances have made me take off a star. Might take off another if the hardware issues continue to pile up.

I am not that nit picky about sound quality, but, 2020 being what it was, I found myself at home all the time and needing a really good pair of headphones. Normally, I wouldnt go for a $278 pair of headphones, but after using these for about 45 days, I'd say they're definitely worth every penny.

So, here's my list of things I care about, in the order that I care about them and the performance of these headphones on those (keep in mind these are my first ""high-end"" i.e. > $100 headphones):

1. COMFORT: Pretty good. While they arent ultra-light, and they don't ""disappear"" from your head, the overall comfort is great. The cup pressure around the ears is uniformly distributed and just enough to not 'pinch' any part of the head too much. The amount of weight carried by the top band isnt so much that you feel it after just couple of hours. Yes, after 3 or so hours, you definitely want to 'free' your ears for a few minutes but that's about it. Ear cup pads are soft and comfortable, but not exactly luxurious, which I expect in this price range to be honest. The top band's padding is good enough at least for now, I hope it remains so 6 months from now too. Will update if necessary. ---------8/10---------

2. SOUND QUALITY: Pretty good again. I'm no audiophile, but I didnt notice any glaring problems with the sound. I listen to all kinds of music, but mainly instrumentals while WFH, podcasts while doing chores and Netflix to unwind, and I like the clarity that they provide for that kind of broad general use. The Sony app also has some great options for the EQ - one of the best I've seen. ---------8/10---------

4. WIRELESS OPERATION: Absolutely LOVE the fact that it can support two devices simultaneously. This - if not supported - is *almost* a deal breaker for me. I need to be able to take calls and listen to music from my phone but also take Zoom calls on my computer without having to disconnect and reconnect. Connecting/disconnecting is easy and not annoying. Signal strength is pretty good, could be better - sometimes I lose the signal in the kitchen which is only ~20 feet and 2 walls away. ---------9/10---------

3. NOISE CANCELLATION: Very good. Both the passive and active are good, but what makes it great is the app control where you can set all sorts of options like ambient noise level to keep, speak-to-chat etc. It has many more options that I dont use, but more optionality = always good. 90% of the time I am just using the passive since its good enough, but I've had some very loud construction or traffic noises in my vicinity and the ANC is pretty good - it takes what would have been almost unbearable to barely and annoyance level. ---------9/10---------

4. CONTROL INTERFACES (BUTTONS) AND APP: This is quite important for daily use obviously, and they've made the right decisions IMO in terms of how complicated the button and touch interface is on the physical headphones and how much there is to control through the Sony app. There are two physical buttons on the left cup for Power and Custom and the right one has a touch interface for skip fwd/bkwd and volume up/down. Minimal and functional. The Sony app on the other hand is chock full of fancy options and customizable control settings. I dont use most of these yet, but love the fact that these exist. If one day we can all hang out together in public once again, I'm sure the map feature where it remembers your level of Ambient sound to let through depending on location would be a great option to program and use. ---------8/10---------

5. BATTERY LIFE: I have used it heavily for more than a day many times without needing to recharge. It also charges up relatively fast. I with the charging cable was longer though. USB-C is a definite plus though.

6. CASE: I dont care about the case too much (again, 2020), but it's fine and does its job. Its not ugly or anything. And is just small enough to not be an annoyance.

Overall, are they worth the hype and the price tag? So far yes, but they better last for over a year of continued daily use for me to really think that they're worth this. But yes for now, definitely so.","February 17, 2021"
S C,1,"I spend hours on long phone calls every single day. I have been using Apple AirPod Pros for this and am very satisfied with the technology. But the in-ear AirPod is causing me a medical problem with my ears, so I needed to find a way to make iPhone phone calls without something sticking into my ear canal.

I decided to try Sony’s high-end WH-1000XM4 wireless headset. When I called the person on the top of my speed dial list to see how the phone call quality was, she said on her end of our phone calls to her were always fuzzy sounding, and that they clipped some beginning and ending syllables. Another frequent caller said our phone calls were alright (though he couldn’t rave about any aspect of the call quality at all). He also said he could no longer hear anyone in the background speaking from across the room when they spoke away from the headset. In my circumstances this can be both good or bad, depending on what results I want.

As the headphone wearer, I found phone conversations to be terrible regardless of the various settings I tried. Phone calls were terrible to listen to as they sounded so forced and unnatural. And they were also terrible to talk on due to inadequate sidetone and unnatural sound of my own voice. Also, the back of the headphones rubbed against my chair and that carried into the headphones acoustically.

The right cup wasn’t big enough, and so usually my right earlobe was scrunched under the cup edge unless I manually adjusted it each time I placed the headphones on my head.

I didn’t like the Sony apps I had to install on my iPhone; they just didn’t feel like they fit well into my chosen Apple ecosystem. There was also something about the initiation process each time I turned them on that forced some manual connect operation. I didn’t like that I had to take the headphones off to adjust my head height, and also in doing so, they shut the headphones off (though I could could change that default if I was willing to turn off the auto shutoff).

The “midnight blue” color might as well have been black. Initial reactions from 3 of 4 of us were that the headphones were black. Not even close to blue. We could see bluish elements by looking carefully, but the perceived color was far closer to midnight black than midnight blue. And I even paid extra for the blue color that I desired and felt that I did not receive.

I liked the volume up and volume down and skip forward and skip back motions, as they were very intuitive. I wish it was available on both sides of my head though, rather than only the one.

I generally was not impressed by the fit and comfort, and never really felt completely comfortable wearing the headphones as there was an angle and tightness that was not fully satisfying.

I really wish there was a lightning-to-headphone cable included, as then I would have tried wired phone calls, though I am pretty sure the lack of decent sidetone would still have been an issue, and I am guessing that the voice quality would have still been an issue to some large degree. Even if wired mode would fix the sound quality completely, I want wireless for my primary usage.

I found the added ability to listen to music or a phone call while also listening to ambient noises or discussions was somewhat more helpful than nothing, but woefully inadequate for routine use, no matter how I adjusted the various controls. And specifically, someone walking up to me and posing a question left one or the other or both of us always feeling frustrated in our communication ability. It was helpful to have some sense of what is going on around me, but not at all helpful to interact with another person intentionally.

The 3D sound was “cute”, and even satisfying, but until my existing library of 400+ albums had some automated 3D effects, why bother? Having a few special 3D albums, while having the totality of my well-loved collection being 2D just made me frustrated with the music that I love and devalued my entire collection in my mind. 3D was novel, but otherwise caused me real dissatisfaction with my collection acquired over the decades. I will always avoid 3D unless my old standbys can electronically simulate some 3D effects on my request.

I am not a high-end audio guy, but my music sounded fine to me. I really needed the phone calls to sound decent, and they instead were unacceptable for business use. These headphones weren’t worth the almost $300 cost to me, and in fact I would pay maybe $50 for them for music listening, and would simply be unwilling to use them for free for routine business phone calls.

I can tell you with certainty that I am going to be returning these Sony WH-1000XM4s, primarily due to telephone call inadequacy, but also because I really wanted a rich dark blue color.","January 27, 2021"
Kinomora,1," 2022 update: THESE HEADPHONES ARE DANGEROUS!
11 months after buying these headphones, on my 1st replacement unit already, they started producing a soft humming sound which quickly turned to an extremely loud screech MUCH louder than the system sound the headphones are connected to. I was able to consistently cause this issue to reproduce and attempted to report it to Sony who simply offered to replace them again! THESE HEADPHONES ARE DANGEROUS AND MAY CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE! DO NOT BUY!

2021 original review:
I bought these to use primarily with my Windows 10 desktop- which these headphones are clearly not designed to be used for.

On Windows, the headphones show up as two separate devices- ""WH-1000XM4 Hands-Free AG Audio"" and ""WH-1000XM4 Stero"". You MUST set the AG Audio one to ""Default Communications Device"" and the Stero one to ""Default Device"" otherwise it simply will not work.
My main grip with these headphones, though, comes from the fact that even though they have 9 integrated microphones for active noise cancelling, you cannot use any of them on PC while in high-fidelity audio mode. The device defaults to an audio quality lower than a piece of string connected to a paper cup if you have an application- like Discord or OBS- actively selected to use the ""AG Audio"" device.
I just decided that I'd use my old, wired headphone's microphone for any audio input I needed, and use these headphones ""as intended by Sony"". Whatever, right? They still sounded amazing, they had amazing noise cancellation to the point where I couldn't even hear someone behind me talking.

Well. That was true until about yesterday, when I started noticing I could hear things around me. I figured maybe my roommates were just being loud, but now I can actively hear someone watching television on the other side of the house while the headphones are set to ""Active Noise Cancelling."" So I've spent all evening looking at forum posts and other threads trying to figure out what happened and I'm finding that many, many other people are having the same issue with not only the XM4's, but the previous XM3's as well. After further testing, I've determined that when the headphones are set to ""Noise Cancelling"", they've actually defaulted to ""Ambient Noise"" with no way to fix this. I have tried factory resetting them, I have tried recalibrating them in the app, I've tried moving the slider around, turning it off, turning it on, resetting the headphones again, uninstalling the app, pressing the CUSTOM button on the side and NOTHING works.

Turns out, Sony doesn't even have a support email. So now I need to wait until their helpline opens for either Live Chat or Phone to be told that I'll need to send them in for repairs. Lucky for me, my return period ended earlier this month so I guess I spent $350 on a pair of headphones that are notorious for experiencing issues after just 2 months of use.

Not to mention that due to the shape and firmness of the headband and the weight of the device overall, likely due to the batteries (which I must say I am impressed with the battery life) I've noticed an unmistakable ""dent"" in my scalp where the band lays. Since I use these for >8 hours at a time, taking them off feels like I'm finally getting home from a long days work transporting water using a pitcher on my head. I've spoken to my doctor about this, and he tells me there's no chance it's permanent but it's very concerning to run my fingers through my head and feel what seems like nearly half an inch deep valley running across the front half of my scalp.

Would I recommend these? Maybe, if you're the kind of person that buys new headphones every other month, and if you're really trying to solidify that Tyler1 cosplay these would be perfect for the job. For everyone else, I'd look elsewhere.","April 1, 2021"
Kindle Customer,1,"I can't get these to work properly in Windows 10. This is with bluetooth 4.0, updated drivers and a history of using Samsung Level On headphones with no issues. When connected to PC it just stutters and cuts in and out, completely unusable. This is using them as headphones in playback mode. If I use them as a headset, which is meant for phone calls and conferencing, then I can actually get them to work but they sound very tinny and the volume is very low. In researching I see this is a common issue with the prior model XM3's and there are various fixes ranging from turning off headset mode to playing with the drivers, I tried all of them and none worked. After several hours of research and seeing how many others didn't resolve this on the XM3's I am about to give up and just return these.

Here is the heartbreaker, using these on my Android phone and they sound superb, perfect, no stutter or cutting out. I downloaded the app and was able to tweak them to sound even better. But again this does nothing for using them on a PC.

One of the features I was most excited about was using these on 2 devices at a time, but it's a mixed bag at best. You have to manually switch them in the app, or turn the connection on/off on the device which is just as much of a pain as any other bluetooth headset without this function. The Android phone seems to be unable to connect back to them many times and I have to go to bluetooth settings and manually connect.

The ANC function is just amazing, I have my home office in a finished basement and have all kinds of furnace/fan and overhead footstep sounds, but with ANC on I heard zero of the furnace/fan, and the overhead footsteps were dampened quite a bit. My main reason to get these was for the ANC and I wasn't disappointed. One issue is that the left earphone has a hiss which sounds like the noise cancellation is a bit more aggressive, it's only noticeable when playing stuff at low or no volume. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but makes the function seem unfinished or faulty and spoils the perfection of the ANC otherwise.

Fit: These fit oddly, they are too large for my head, and I have a pretty large head. Most headphones are small on me, but these, even shortened all the way, still sit slightly below my ears. I can place the top band towards the front of my head to correct this, but it takes away from the comfort. The earphones themselves are not as comfortable as I hoped they would be based on reviews. One reason I was upgrading from the Samsung Level On's is because the Level On's earpieces are kind of small and caused fatigue on my ears after a few hours. While the Sony's earpieces are larger, I feel the way they sit on your head will make them just as fatiguing, maybe worse as they are fairly heavy. The top band doesn't have suspension system as I would expect with something this expensive, just some foam.

So overall I wanted to love these, and I do except for the fact that I cannot get them to work on a Windows 10 PC. Judging by the plethora of issues I found in searching for this issue with the XM3's it seems I'm not alone. Unfortunately, regardless of how good they are, that's useless for me if I can't even use them and I have to rate them at 1 star. Will most likely be returning these unless I can find a solution.","October 16, 2020"
James Hawden,1,"I get almost daily Amazon deliveries, often gadgets and electronics, and have done for many years. This purchase was a first for me - the first time I have ever returned a product to Amazon!

I've been using some in-ear headphones (from a leading brand) for some time now but find they irritate inside my ears. My use case is primarily at night when the wife goes to sleep and I stay up for an hour watching TV but not wanting the sound to disturb her. After a lot of research and reading of reviews, I settled on these Sony WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones and found a good Prime day bargain.

The headphones arrived and were fairly easy to setup with the app. I listened to some music from my iPhone for a while to test them out and they sounded great. The noise canceling was incredible and I found them very comfortable. I was very pleased with my purchase.

Why then is this a poor review and why have I returned them? Put simply; they just aren't usable with the TV. I've used them for 4 nights with the TV (Samsung) and have had issues with the sounds constantly breaking up, dropping out completely, distorting the sound, and an awful lip sync issue. I've used many Bluetooth headphones over the years, with the same TV, room, and setup, and never had issues like this.

After night 1, I did some research and found suggestions to update the firmware. I learned I already had the latest. Next up were some suggestions to tweak the settings in the app, including switching from best quality to best stability. These didn't help. I tried a full reset, repairing, adjusting the TV options, but to no avail.

It seems to me that these headphones could be great if using for music on a phone, but there seems to be some major Bluetooth challenges either specific to Samsung TV's, or when not right next to the device. Laying in bed, the TV is only 10ft away, so range should not be an issue.

Wireless interference is possible, but not something that's been an issue with any other Bluetooth headphones so I can only see this being an option if it's a low quality Bluetooth transmitter. Having tried and experienced the same issue on a different Samsung TV in a different room, this further leads me to think it's not interference.

My best guess is they don't play nicely with the different codec used on Samsung TV's and, from all the forum posts I've read, it seems others have come to similar conclusions following issues with Samsung TV's specifically.

Having grabbed a Prime day bargain, it pains me to now return these for a refund and now spend more buying an alternative set at full price. I'm not ruling Sony out given these are widely accepted as the best headphones, perhaps I will try the newer M5's to see if they work better - but I will also look at the Bose 700 and Apple Airpod Max as comparable alternatives.","July 28, 2022"
Marco A.,1,"I bought one pair of these headphones and they were defective out of the box. I returned them and the replacement was even WORSE than the first one. If two out of two of the same product are broken out-of-the-box, you have failed as a company.

Sony doesn't even care either! My replacement order was shipped to me in a box just as slim as the box the headphones come in and only slightly longer with absolutely NO packing protection. So during the whole transit period the headphones I paid a lot of money for were pretty much completely exposed to all sorts of damage.

That damage took its toll on the headphones because as I had said, the original and replacement headphones were defective out-of-the-box. From here on in this review I will only be referring to the replacement headphones I received because Amazon refused to give me the functioning product that I paid for.

So, here is what defective on arrival Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are like after under 9 months of use.

1) Right ear cup has serious heat issues. While the headphones are charging, the right ear cup heats up to at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit. You can't put the headphones on for at least 20 minutes after charging unless you want to burn the side of your head or worst case scenario, the electronics on your right ear explode and blind you or make you deaf.

2) Battery life inconsistent. Some days it takes hours to go down 10-20%, other days it drops by 40% in one hour.

3) Noise cancelling becomes a ""ruin my eardrums"" setting. This past 14 days I can't even turn on noise cancelling because of how defective these headphones are. I realized this when the headphones first arrived but I wasn't allowed to return them. Basically, the right ear cup always sounds like your ear is pressed against an ocean shell only MUCH louder. The ear cup is amplifying the blood rushing through your ear and pumping it back into your ear and looping that process. This has gotten worse and worse with every passing day. On top of the amplified blood-rushing sound there is a whooshing and popping sound that messes with your equilibrium and the difference in audio your ears hear makes you nauseous. That isn't even the worst part! 14 days ago while I was going through this $400 audio hell Sony calls ""headphones"" my right ear touched the interior right ear cup 0.01% more than normal because I turned my head slightly and all of those previous negative sound qualities happened at once AND the headphones started emitting an insanely high pitched frequency that looped on itself increasing in sharpness similar to when you drop a mic near a concert speaker and you get that high pitched feedback, only this was much much worse because it was pumped directly into my eardrum. I ripped the headphones off my head and the sound continued to increase in volume until the light sensor kicked in and muted the headphones.

Both Sony and Amazon has failed here. Sony failed at making headphones that aren't defective on arrival and Amazon has failed at shipping packages without breaking them and then not letting a customer return said broken product.","January 19, 2022"
H. Akan,1,"I have one of the oldest versions of these headphones. As I am a wage slave there was no justification for splurging on a headphone of this price range when I bought this. I do not recall the thought process that went into the initial purchase decision. (I suspect no thought went into it. But let's not dwell on the mistakes of the past impede us...)

I am a product of the western education; as a result, I am a nihilist. As such, life has very little to offer other than sex, food and displaying superiority over my fellow men with the hope of getting more of the former two.

Last week, as I was feeling especially oppressed by the thoughts of existentialist angst, I felt a sudden urge of something missing in my life, perhaps goaded by the Prime Day Sale on Amazon. So I decided to buy a newer (nay, the newest) version of the headphones, compounding my earlier folly.

I, like many before me, made the assumption that if something is newer it ought to be better. I have found that this headphone shows no distinct superiority over it's predecessors excepting being shinier and more expensive. In fact, my older version of the headphone is better in terms of built quality and response time.

If you are a like me: That is, a fool who hasn't got $300 to waste but in possession of the earlier version of these headphones. I urge you not buy this since it is in no way better than the earlier headphones.

Goodbye dear public.

For the price you pay for these headphones you would expect them to perform much, much better in the software area. For one, if you buy these for PC as I did, there is no way to control really anything besides the volume. The touch controls are awful, either by being unresponsive or by reacting to nothing, and the 2 physical buttons can't be remapped to do other functions than the default and there is no software to change anything except through the phone apps. Second, even the options you can control on the phone, the headphones frequently just revert to defaults. It has this very useful wind cancellation function that isn't on by default so you have to activate it EVERY TIME you turn on the headphones. But while it's on it does work well with a fan pointed on me.
The biggest reason I went with these headphones over others was the accolades others had given them related to the noise cancellation. I really feel like I'm just missing out or got a bum pair because the ANC on these is barely above average. Not bad but just a lot worse than I was expecting for over $300.
The battery life deserves high praise, however. I have only heard the low battery warning once in the 5 months I have used these. Seriously great lifespan. Also the Bluetooth range is impressive. Much longer on my phone than on my PC but I can be in an entirely different room and still maintain a good connection. Your mileage may vary here.

1 Year Edit: Changed from 2* to 4*. I have used these for several hours daily the last year and they are showing no signs of aging. I recently had to use a different set temporarily and once I was done and able to put these back on, the change (increase) in comfort between the 2 sets was noticeable. I may have been too harsh with 2*. They still sound great and the battery is still going strong. I ended up turning the touch features off altogether.

January 2023: I bought these October 2021, 15 months of ownership. Dropped down from 4* to 3* for this deafening, piercing screech that happened suddenly. A quick search shows this is common when the noise-cancelling microphones need cleaning. When I say this sound is deafening, I really, really mean it. I could hear it across the house. Fortunately I wasn't wearing them at the time, I had taken them off to talk to someone in the kitchen. If I was wearing them I'm sure there would have been hearing damage. I found a Youtube video that showed how to take the earcups off so I could clean it and so far, so good. We'll see.

DirceuSilva,1,"I've had the unfortunate experience of using the Sony WH1000XM4 headphones, and I must say, they have been nothing short of a massive disappointment. At first, they seemed like a dream come true, but as time went on, they revealed their true colors - a dysfunctional product backed by an inept and unhelpful tech support team.

For a good five months, I was able to connect these headphones to my Samsung TV without issue. However, recently they've decided to go on strike and refuse to connect at all. You'd think that for the premium price tag, these headphones would have the decency to function as intended.

To make matters worse, the brief period when they did connect was marred by an annoying lag in the sound. I eventually got used to it, but it was certainly not the seamless experience I had anticipated from such a ""high-end"" product.

When I reached out to Sony tech support for assistance, I was met with a less than helpful response. They outright blamed my Samsung TV's software for the issue, despite it connecting flawlessly with all other devices. It's baffling that Sony refuses to acknowledge any issues on their end.

In the face of such blatant denial, I was told there was nothing they could do to help me. It's as if their entire tech support team is an assembly of ostriches, burying their heads in the sand and pretending problems don't exist. This lack of accountability and commitment to customer satisfaction is beyond frustrating.

In conclusion, the Sony WH1000XM4 headphones have been a colossal disappointment. Their performance is subpar, plagued by connectivity issues and audio lag, making them a terrible choice for those seeking a reliable pair of headphones. To add insult to injury, Sony's tech support team seems to have taken a crash course in customer alienation and incompetence, making the entire experience an exercise in futility and aggravation.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the Sony WH1000XM4 headphones to anyone. Save yourself the headache and frustration, and steer clear of these overpriced, underperforming headphones. With so many other options on the market, it's not worth subjecting yourself to the abysmal customer service and technical shortcomings of Sony's offering.

If you're looking for a quality audio experience and reliable customer support, look elsewhere. Sony has truly dropped the ball with the WH1000XM4 headphones and their so-called ""tech support."" It's a shame that a once-reputable brand has stooped so low.","April 3, 2023"
Morgan McCool,1,"The good things: Good noise canceling

The bad things: Everything else

1: No pass through charging, if the headset dies you can't charge it while using it. It also weirdly doesn't charge on the USB port from my PC when it's off, even though every other device does on the same port.

2: Windows confuses the input/output for the headset often, especially on Zoom calls or games. You have to dig into settings to fix it and it happens constantly. If you REALLY need to be on a zoom call, don't depend on these to work reliably.

3: There is a ""feature"" that lets the headphones pause whatever you are listening to automatically when it hears you talking, but it's WAY to sensitive. If you laugh out loud, it pauses. If you sigh, it pauses. Breathe too loud, it pauses. It is infuriating. You CAN turn it off with the app that lets you pick your settings, but the settings do not stick. Every few weeks it randomly forgets my settings and I have to disconnect it from my computer, connect it to the app on my phone, change the settings again, reconnect to my computer, and wait for it to inevitably happen again.

4: There are no buttons for audio/volume, just a touch panel on the right headphone. This too is WAY too sensitive. You will constantly accidentally pause or skip or restart whatever you are listening to. If you are two hours into a podcast or audiobook and decide to brush your hair over your ear, you will restart it and lose your place.

5: The battery life is garbage for the price, which is especially bad since as mentioned previously you can't charge it while using it.

6: The ""connect two bluetooth devices"" feature just simply doesn't work, at least not on mine.

I've been using this headset for a long time and I regret the purchase. It has a million annoyances that make it unreliable for both work and leisure. Even if it was a quarter the price it wouldn't be worth the constant issues, because it doesn't reliably do the ONE thing headphones should do -- play audio when you want it it too.","January 25, 2023"
Yoshi,1,"I do not know why these headphones are so hyped up! I am not a headphone expert or anything special however my MPOW base, sound, and feel are 100 times better and they were only 20 bucks. This 350 piece of plastic has so many complicated pieces to it, but it can not perform well on just sound alone. If you like having to adjust the sound on the app-that they force you to get because the regular sound is so basic-then this may be the product for you. If you like the sound being extremely low even when you move it up to a higher volume then this is the product for you. They are super bulky and the sound controls are trash! When listening to my MPOW headphones(which are not noise-canceling) I feel like I get better noise-canceling quality. With these headphones, I could still hear a tennis ball being hit back and forth even though I am sitting across the field, and this is with music playing. So you may be thinking, let me just buy it to try it out then return it if I do not like it! Think again, with amazons new return policies you can not simply go to your local UPS to drop it off, now you have to go to far-out Amazon lockers or wait by your door all day for the UPS man to come to pick it up. Not worth the buy, the try, or even the time wasted.","August 20, 2023"
William,1,"Loved them for first like 9 months. Did everything I wanted them to do. Then one day they stopped charging with a cable that I’ve been using with no issues on any other device. Didn’t use them for a little, throught the port was broken or maybe somehow was damaged from sweat from gym ?. Ended up getting them to charge w a new charger but now they can charge for hours you’ll never see a blue light saying signaling full charge. When turned on always a low battery warning and says 10% charged. Can get a few hours out of it still but never know when it’ll die/ battery life was much much better before. Not even under a year and $300 kinda wasted. Way out of return window.

I didn’t want to like these Sony WH-1000XM4 ANC headphones, I actually ordered a set of Shure AONIC 50 several hours after I ordered the Sonys. I thought for sure the Shure AONIC 50 would be the keepers and I would be returning the Sony set. However, despite all of the flaws with the Sony, the Active Noise Cancellation on this set is in a completely different level than the Shure AONIC 50. I live in a large urban apartment complex situated near a busy six lane highway, and when I put the Sony WH-1000XM4 on, the external noise just seems to magically disappear, including the A/C fan blower noise… as an autistic this is simply amazing! For instance, one of the residents here owns a very loud Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and the other day they fired it up, I reached for the Sonys and when I put them on I though for a moment that he turned the motorcycle off, so I took them off and quickly realized the motorcycle was still running.

I would say the Shure AONIC 50 is clearly superior in build quality, materials, style, and audio fidelity. The Shure AONIC 50 has a built-in 32-bit @ 384 kHz USB-C DAC, so you can charge and listen to high fidelity music on your computer at the same time. Why Sony didn’t include a built-in USB-C DAC in these headphones is something I have trouble comprehending… forehead slap, as a major problem with the Sonys is you can’t charge them and listen to music at the same time. In fact, when I connect both the 3.5mm and USB-C cables to the Sony, a loud feedback loop hum is produced by the headphones. The Shure AONIC 50 has superior audio fidelity, but the sound is very flat… as in they would be good studio monitor headphones (iTunes has a software equalizer to make adjustments). The Sony also has good audio fidelity (just only slightly behind the Shure) but has a frequency response profile that is more desirable to consumers out of the box without adjustments, I would say it sounds more lively or dynamic out. I drive the Sonys with a S.M.S.L. AD18 USB DAC, set to 24-bit @ 96 kHz output.

The other problem with the Sony set is if you want to do multi-device bluetooth support you have to drop down to the SBC audio codec, which sounds like garbage in my opinion. The Shure seem to support multi-device support using the AAC audio codec, which easily sounds better than SBC. For an Apple multi-device ecosystem the Shure would likely be the better choice in terms of audio fidelity.

Bottom line, if you want the best ANC then get the Sonys, if you want something that is highly portable then get the Sonys, otherwise in most all other cases the Shure AONIC 50 are the better choice. If Shure can improve the ANC with a firmware update (the version I tested was 0.4.9) they would definitely have a best in class product.","October 17, 2020"
Obsidia,1,"I bought these to replace my old Sony CH700N's. They're definitely an upgrade in every department except battery life. They sound great, the noise cancelling is industry leading, they look amazing. However, the first pair I bought had horrible battery life. Like I was not even getting 8 hours out of them with ANC turned off. Figured my unit was defective, so I had them replaced with a new pair. I've had the new pair for about 3 weeks now, everything seemed alright. Battery was ok, but not great. I was never able to get anywhere near the advertised 30 hours. I tried with ANC off, and was having to charge them every other day, and using them anywhere between 5-10 hours on said days. I was getting max 20 hours with no ANC and stuff like DSEE disabled.

Then today all of a sudden I start the day with 100% (charged all night), now 5 hours later I get a beep and it says ""battery low"". I check to see how much is left, yep 10% left. I went ahead and plugged them in, and came back 20 min later just to see how much charged, and it said fully charged. These are supposed to take 3 hours to fully charge, so something is not right. This is really upsetting, because I love these headphones, but if the battery is going to be wonky like this in two pairs now, it's gonna be a deal breaker.

My CH700N's on the other hand can go 3-4 days on a charge, and I use them a good 5-10 hours a day. I also don't even turn them off when I'm not using them. They've been rock solid with battery life, so to be experiencing battery issues with the Xm4's its disappointing.

Pros:
- Sound quality is exceptional
- ANC is top tier
- Build quality is nice, feels very premium
- Comes with hardshell case
- Android app has a lot of features

Cons:
- Battery (I can only speak from my experience with having 2 different units)
- Stock earpads are not great, they pancake flat","December 21, 2022"
Bros,1,"Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones with Mic for phone.

PROS :
1) Best noise cancelling on the current market Period in all frequencies.
2) Sound quality incredibly balanced & adjustable with the App to individual taste
3) Exceptionally comfortable, only beaten by the Bose 35s
4) Excellent connectivity stable connection with 2 devices at once
5) 30 hours battery life

CONS:
1) No AptX LL. This is a reason for me to send them back since I watch movies with head phones. In this day & age we need low latency to watch video content.
This is unforgivable since Sony was notified in their previous version the WH-1000XM3 it was a must.
2) Wind turns the ambient sound feature on & off. This is beyond annoying. Thank goodness it can be turned off
3) If it's windy one can hear wind in a phone conversation. This is not a problem with the Bose 700s
4) The ears will get quite warm if the headphones are worn for long periods.
5) I'm still not a fan of the swipe controls. They can be glitchy. For instance when trying to turn volume up or down, sometimes it pauses the music & other times it switches to the next track.

Overall Sony has improved the WH-1000XM4 from the previous generation but it could be better, much better with a few tweaks & recommendations above to become the ultimate noise cancelling bluetooth headphones on the market.

****EDIT**** I had to send the unit back because the automatic quick attention mode where human voices turn the music off went hay wire. Every sound started to turn the unit off. It didn't matter in the app if that feature was on or off, it kept doing it. This is a major flaw in the design. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this model. It's frustrating beyond belief....Now I star","September 14, 2020"
Amazon Customer,1,The product I received was defective. The bluetooth would not connect to my mobile phone. It would appear on my mobile phone and would try to pair but it would not connect. It did not matter if I turned bluetooth off on all my other devices or had the phone and headset close to one another. I tried resetting the device and this still did not work. I was unable to use the mobile app to resolve this because the bluetooth wouldn't connect to my mobile phone in the first place. The app is only on android and apple so I wasn't able to use any other means to access it's settings or software. When I tried connecting to my desktop or laptop using bluetooth it would connect for a few minutes but would quickly disconnect without warning resulting in the headset losing audio functionality. I'm returning the product and requesting a refund.,"November 29, 2023"
CQ,1,"Noice canceling was great but any sound I make automatically takes you out of noise canceling mode and it’s annoying, there’s no way to turn off this setting even on the Sony app that comes with the headphones. There’s a checkbox that when selected, activates this auto sensing feature but when I deselect this checkbox, the noise canceling still turns off at every sound I make , loud or soft.

The worst part is when trying to use these as your audio and mic on a Microsoft Teams or WebEx meeting off my windows pc laptop. Regardless if it’s connected to my pc via Bluetooth or via wire, it still doesn’t work or at best intermittently cuts off as you’re using it. The end user experience creates this panic situation because you don’t realize that it has stopped working and you can’t hear any of the participants talking, so after a while when you haven’t heard any sound for a minute, you realize it stopped working as an audio output and mic input so you scramble to change to PC speakers/mic , but not until after you’ve missed a minutes worth of Talk.
So after a couple of times thst this happens, the next time you use it, you have this doubt when ther it’s gonna work or fail again so you end up never using it for fear of it failing and making yourself sound flustered and out of sorts to the other participants. It’s the same issue even when you connect to the pc using the wire it came with. The headphones were fully charged so it wasn’t an issue of low battery. It has amazing battery life and noise cancelation but the sound quality was disappointing.

I love songs that are torch ballads sung by vocalists who can saang ( this means people who can really sing like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, singers that will cause heads to turn when you hear them sing any song ) but with these headphones no matter what preset equalizer settings you choose the sound is still muddy you can’t appreciate the crisp sound of the Phillips, LG, or Anker’s top anc headphones. I have an iPhone 12 Max when I listen to music on YouTube Premier or Apple Music.","July 9, 2022"
RainieC,1,"I bought these headphones, Sony WH-1000XM4, for my adult daughter for her birthday around six months ago. She had been enjoying them as they WERE very, very comfortable and the sound quality was decent.

She had been enjoying them until yesterday, when carrying them from one room to another, she heard a little sound and saw a broken piece of plastic on the floor. She checked her headphones and a small piece of plastic holding the hinge to the earpiece had broken. Now the earpiece is wobbly and the noise cancelation won’t work properly. She is also afraid they will break more if she tries to continue to use them.

She had not dropped her headphones. She took good care of the headphones and loved them. So I contacted the tech department of Sony via chat. They told me this is considered physical damage and is not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Then I called the same department and they said the same thing. I asked to speak to someone else. So the Sony National Customer Relations contacted me today. They told me the same thing. Which to sum it up, they will not fix the headphones which are broken due to poor quality.

I told each person that I spoke or chatted with that this is really a defect of the product and should be covered. It is truly a manufacturer’s defect by choosing poor quality material to use in the product. These headphones when I bought them were almost $300, now they are more for the same poor quality from a company that does not stand behind their product, who does not care about their customer.

In my opinion, these headphones should only be about fifty dollars if they are not going to last. I would have expected them, to last at least three years, not a mere six months. SONY should give out a piece that one can snap back into place for those with this issue. We will never buy headphones from these shysters again. We’ve had Beats headphones that last much longer with the only issue being the cushion wearing out.","October 17, 2022"
jctejada77,1,"Bought these in May of 2021 and in November of 2023 I finally had to throw them in the garbage. When you spend over $200+ for headphones you’d expect to get at least 5 years of use out of them. After about 1 year of use they started to make this weird feedback noise when I put them on. Researched the issue online and several people have had this issue but apparently Sony won’t even acknowledge this issue exists, ultimately I was able to find a fix. Unfortunately the problem started again recently and by this time I was fed up and just tossed them in the garbage. I expected so much more from Sony especially since pretty much every electronic I own is Sony branded but clearly headphones aren’t their thing or at the very least the quality is very lacking.","November 27, 2023"
Benjamin Yin,1,"For such a highly reviewed product. This headphone is absolute garbage.
.
ANC:
The ANC is no better than a cheap $50 pair of headphones. It's not only worse in how much cancellation it's able to produce compared to the Bose QC45, it also has that trademarked budget-ANC white noise static hum. I contacted customer service at one point about the static in the ANC and they literally said that it's expected. Absolutely ridiculous given how expensive this pair of headphones are. I have never experienced this with any other ANC headphones that cost more than $150. The worse part though, is that the ANC broke in the worse way possible after 13 months, right after the warranty expired. It now produces an extremely loud, high-pitched whine after turning on the ANC. I'm thinking there's some sort of feedback in its ANC mic system. This will actually cause hearing damage.

Sound:
I have a relatively large collection of headphones, and the XM4 is mediocre at best in terms of it's sound quality. Overbearing and muddy bass.

Comfort:
Comfort is okay. But not stellar, I felt a very slight discomfort after wearing for more than a few hours. And I have a number of cans that are more comfortable, and a few that are less.

Quality:
Mediocre build quality. I already mentioned the broken ANC. Fact is, compared to other expensive headphones, the Sony XM4 is mediocre at best. Nothing about it says premium, which I suppose it absolutely is not.

Conclusion:
Given that the main purpose of buying the XM4 would be for its ANC. You would have better luck with other headphones. I didn't immediately return mine because I thought firmware updates would improve its performance. The fact that it broke completely right out of warranty leaves a particular sour taste. Do I regret purchasing these headphones? Absolutely. Don't make the same mistake I did.","March 19, 2023"
James,1,"The sound quality of these headphones are amazing. About this as a birthday present for myself. And I wish I wasn't so stubborn and returned when I could.....

The interface of these headphones is just horrible. It is suffering from too many features syndrome.

At first glance one might think that the hidden buttons on the headset is a cool thing but it isn't.

I keep hitting a Invisible button that turns on a setting force it's on a setting for ""speak-to-chat"" which just turns off all of your music and plays the ambient sounds around you.

The problem is that the button is invisible and I can't figure out where it is on the headset so I know it is on the headset so I need to download an app connect my headset app connect my headsets to the app go into the settings and turn on into the settings and turn off speak-to-chat there.... which has become past repetitive.

Another annoying aspect about this device is that when I have it connected to my laptop did to my laptop I can't grab my phone I can't grab my phone go to the Bluetooth settings and tell it to connect to the headset and tell it to connect to the headset. I have to go to my laptop first forcibly disconnected from the laptop and then tell my phone to connect to it.
My old headset, which was also Bluetooth and a different brand, I could just go to my phone and click on connect and it would connect regardless if it was paired already to something.

Having to remember to disconnect my headset before I can connect to something else is annoying.

Feels like When designing this product That there was a set goal in mind for the number of features. And that was the only goal, Having the features actually played nice with one another was was not a part of the planning...

And the concept behind speak-to-chat doesn't make sense to me. It is a setting for the headset to detect you talking So that it will play the ambient sounds AKA allow you to talk to somebody else. But even when I stop talking it doesn't switch back. It is really annoying when you're just sitting down vibing out and all of your music stops......

If I want to talk to somebody I will just take off the damn headset..... who thought this was a good idea........","July 13, 2021"
Monroe,1,"1. If you like to listen to music around 70% volume and texts come through, it's very loud. Sounds like 150% and the only way to turn it down according to google and Sony is to turn down the sound. That would mean listen to music at lower volume. Why can't there be separate way to control notifications?

2. ""Ambient Sound"" mode is always on by default. It's very annoying because I never use it. So you have to open the app, sometimes the app takes 7 seconds to open sometimes 2 seconds. Flip a page. Toggle ambient sound off.

3. The google assistant can tell you ""you have an email, or a text from Mr.X"". Useless to me because in order for it to read the email subject or the text message, you have to use your hands on it like a babies toy. I can't understand why there is no setting to allow it to read it out without requiring the press of a button. I know I have an email because of unique sound notification. I know who the text is from because custom notification for each person. To me this feature is very useless. It's double the notification and I can't turn it off in the Sony app. I have to turn it off in the google settings.

4. If you are using blue-tooth and you want to plug in the cable, remember to turn off the headphones or else the battery gets drained. Sony says this is not suppose to happen, but it has happened. I sometimes plug in the cable and forget to turn them off.

5.Ambient sound seriously needs improvements. That Sony commercial about walking outdoors and hearing the traffic around you is total BS. If there is a small wind outside, you will hear so much wind you will go insane trying to use the ambient sound. The option menu gives you level 1 to 20, I can't go beyond level 3. Either a dead cat or better software is needed.

6. There is a feature that will pause the music when it hears you speak... if someone doesn't speak for 3 seconds, max 5 seconds, the music should return in my opinion. It's actually set to 15 seconds and no way to change it. So when you say anything, the music will pause 15 seconds before playing.

7. The same size speakers are disappointing. I was hoping for more bass that can be felt.

Sony says they appreciate my feedback and will work on updates. I decline to keep these because it's not worth the price.","January 23, 2021"
David J. Hankins,1,"Originally the headphones were great. But over time, an extremely loud, high-pitched whine, so loud to the point of possible eardrum damage, occurred in the right speaker.

At first, I could get around this by pressing down hard on the right speaker. But that stopped working after a while. Next, I could turn off noise canceling and recalibrate it using the app - but that too stopped working.

Eventually, the headphones produced a high pitched noise-feedback whine at all times whether or not noise canceling was on.

Maybe I got a lemon - but I've read on the Internet of others having similar experiences (in fact several 1-star reviews report this same issue). I recommend that you do not purchase these headphones.
===
Other problems:
1) The speak-to-stop playback feature would come to life all on its own from time to time. This makes the headphones turn off for a while if you talk. This feature is undesirable for me since I game and talk to others over discord. To turn the feature off you need to connect it to your phone and disable it from there. This takes about 5 minutes;
2) On Windows 11, sometimes you need to fiddle with sound settings to make the headphones the default sound device in spite of having made them default previously;
3) The press down on the speaker to control your headphones feature wasn't to my liking. I'd occasionally touch the right speaker accidentally and it would respond by changing the volume or some other such thing. I ended up disabling this.
===
I purchased a pair of Apple AirPods max to replace these headphones. The AirPods are fantastic so far. No wonky touch-the-headphones to control them - instead, there are dedicated volume and noise cancellation buttons. And connecting the Airpods to my iPhone or to Windows 11 is seamless.

Although more expensive, I recommend the AirPods instead of the WH-1000XM4. The noise whine issue is a deal breaker for the Sony headphones.","August 2, 2022"
MATTHEW T DIEDEN,1,"I bought these headphones because I have a newer SONY television and thought they might pair with them nicely. SONY has decided to put in a lot of USELESS features that are very difficult to disable. In particular, the talk to chat feature - or whatever they're calling the feature that interrupts your program if the slightest outside noise is picked up by the headphone sensors. Pure CRAP. I found this extremely difficult to disable and when you are able to accomplish what should be a simple task, the headphones RE-enable this annoying feature with the slightest tap on the wrong place on the ear cup. Just stupid.
Also, connecting more than one bluetooth enables device is a nightmare. My phone usually jumps in first and the TV must be manually connected - or I have to disable my phone's bluetooth or unpair my phone from the headphones.
Help online says don't bother working with the headphones, as it's more bother than it's worth.
This purchase is the BIGGEST waste of money I have spent in a long, long time. So disappointed, andf it has me rethinking any future SONY purchases.
I can't return them now, but I will donate them to charity and buy a different brand. I DO NIOT want to use these annoying headphones another day.","August 6, 2023"
Max Weiner,1,"At first glance these are great headphones. I had bought them “Used” but in great condition off Amazon. When I first started using them they were comfortable, very noise-cancelling and sounded great. HOWEVER, randomly one of the ear speakers (right one for me) produces an insanely loud high pitched noise! Loud enough to be heard from down my apartment hall and in the kitchen! Luckily I have taken them off before it has gotten too loud but if I were to have left them on my ear drums would have been gone. If you explore a site like Reddit you can see I am not the only one by a long shot. Hundreds of people have experienced the same thing as me. Now I’ve been trying to return them for weeks and have been hit with so much hassle. This is my first review ever because these headphones have cause me such a headache (figuratively and literally).","October 31, 2023"
Amazon Customer,1,"I've owned the Bose top of the line and the air pods pro. I Figured I'd try these Sony due to solid reviews.

I can't tell a difference in Noise Canceling quality to the Bose. The air pods pro are good for size reasons, but they can't perform the same as the over the ear, for obvious reasons. I've been using the Sony for months now. The good parts are fine (not mind blowing) and the bad parts make me want to throw these things through a window.

Bad

1. The touch controls are terrible and never do what you want, but will reliably skip tracks or pause when you don't want it to. I figured out how to turn this off and how to adjust the headphones on my head without touching them in the wrong spot. But as far as I know I can't control volume now from the device.

2. The Sony lady's ""voice"" that tells you what devices you are connected to drowns out phone calls. If you are on a business call and the bluetooth connects or disconnects to your laptop or phone then she will say ""bluetooth device two is disconnected"" and you can't hear what your colleague is saying. Why would I rather be alerted to a computer connecting than to hear what someone in a business meeting is telling me? Drives me nuts and it happens on every single call and then i have to say I'm sorry I lost you there can you repeat that.

3. THEY PAUSE IF YOU LAUGH. Do you ever watch a movie or god forbid listen to a comedy special? Well you better not laugh, because the headphones will pause the media. Talk about ruining the moment, something funny happens and then the headphones just kill it like someone yelled cops are here at a college party, but without the excitement. I find myself watching or listening to things in utter silence, trying to stifle any laughs or noises as if the Germans are hunting me.

What a terrible implementation of an idea.

Sony made a decent product and then totally ruined it with software.","November 20, 2021"
Zoomer,1,"Major hardware failure less than 2 years after purchase. Whistling noise loud enough to BURST your eardrum.

Looking around online and it seems this is a common failure point. The headphones emit a piercing, VERY LOUD screeching noise before even 2 years of usage. When they worked, they were stunning, but now? I cannot emphasize enough how much of a hazard these are. The screech is much louder than the headphones themselves at full volume.

Worst part is it seems the earsplitting noise comes from some ear detection system. I.e., the screech only occurs moments AFTER you put the headphones on. There is no warning sign leading up to failure. One day, out of nowhere, you will put these headphones on, and you will have your ear blasted out.

And, for clarity, I am very gentle with my stuff. Never did anything to damage these headphones, there's not so much as a scratch on them after 2 years.

There are a few ""fixes"" posted online, from compressing the offending ear-cup for minutes on end, to completely tearing them down and playing with the internals (do NOT do this). I did the former for a time, but eventually even that will stop working.

The warranty only lasts 1 year, and it seems this issue crops up for most after about 2 to 3. Go figure.","June 9, 2023"
Steve D.,1,"I have had these headphones for about a year and a half. Well, I've only had the ones I'm currently using for about 6 months. The first set started to have charging and power issues within a few months. I reached out to Sony customer service and they replaced them. Now on the second set I'm running into a similar problem. I always charge with the provided power cord, and since they don't provide a charging block, I use an Anker two port block with a maximum of 24W. I have never had issues charging any other item using this block. I'm not sure if somehow I've managed to receive two defective units, but at this point it would seem that charging is a recurring issue with this particular model.

Update: The New unit has stopped charging 6 months after receiving it. I spoke to Sony customer service and they only warranty the replacement they provided for 90 days and not the full year as if it was an original purchase. With this in mind, don't waste your money. Buy a product at half the price, let it break and then buy a new one. These are overpriced garbage!","July 12, 2023"
Dan,1,"The headphones themselves are fine. They sound good and aren't too uncomfortable.

Now for the issues, which make these headphones a no-go for me:
1) App Necessity - In order to pair with a device, apparently you have to install the app on your phone. This is a problem in itself, as I shouldn't need an app! Bluetooth pairing should be all one needs to do. Additionally, there is no app for Windows 10 and I wanted these headphones primarily for work on a Windows laptop. You have to use the app on a phone in order to pair the headphones to a laptop. What a fail.
2) Pairing Issues - The headphones do not consistently pair to devices, when attempted.
3) Switching between two devices - So, I had these headphones connected to my phone (by necessity - see above) and to my laptop. Switching between the two is a nightmare - it just doesn't always work. Additionally, and this is my chief complaint, when I am on a work call on my laptop and then I get a call (usually a spam call) on my phone, the headphones automatically switch to the phone. Even when I ignore the call on my phone, the headphones do not automatically connect back to the laptop. This makes these headphones completely unusable for work. Imagine presenting to a client and this happens. Now for the kicker - I contacted Sony support and they said there is no way to disable the auto-switchover feature. Wow...

With respect to #3, I found a quasi-workaround. First, I tried to just disconnect the headphones from the phone, but I would have to do this every single time I put the headphones on, because they auto-connect to the phone. Then, I just deleted the app from my phone and also deleted the bluetooth connection on my phone. Now, the switch-over issue doesn't happen, but I can't use the headphones with my phone without setting up and deleting the bluetooth connection each time.

As such, I am returning these","August 25, 2021"
Michael Bingham-Hawk,1,"These are the most expensive headphones I have ever and they are by far the worst. First, I have only had them 6 months. My gripes about them prior to them literally falling apart are many. They have a mind of their own. There are hundreds of times the speak to chat feature gets activated by some random touch on the headphones. No matter how many times you turn it off in the Sony software, it will get reactivated. As a result when you say something while listening to music, you get a flood of white noise for 10 seconds while waiting for the music to resume and noise canceling to reengage. They are completely useless in conference calls as they do nothing to filter ambient room noise. About a week ago the seam that joins the top and bottom plastic of the head-strap began coming apart near one of the ear pieces. The separation got so bad, now the ear piece dangles out of the socket. When I called Sony, they said the 1 year warranty does not cover physical damage. I tried to explain that the glue was no longer holding the headband together, thus the ear piece was not staying in the socket. They only said I could pay to repair them. I told them to stick it where the sun don’t shine. I will never again purchase any product made by Sony, no matter what it is. Prior to these Sony subpar headphones, I bought SkullCandy for years. Their warranty is amazing. If something happens, even physical damage, you ship it back to them and then they credit your account (usually for the full purchase price) and you can use the credit to purchase another set.","August 6, 2022"
Joe,1,"Let me preface this by saying I had originally purchased a prior version of this headphone, the WH-1000XM2's, and I liked them a lot for a while. The noise cancelling was good, the battery life was good and the headphones just worked. However after a year or so the right earphone started developing a popping/clicking noise when noise cancelling was enabled. There was also occasionally an extremely loud screech/feedback noise from the headphones when ANC was on. I contacted Sony support and eventually I got them to agree to send a replacement set. That set never arrived, I'm not sure why but I didn't feel like jumping through any more hoops as it was already like pulling teeth to get them to admit their product broke so I just turned off ANC.

Then the WH-1000XM4's were released and I decided to buy a pair as my XM2s were showing their age. And it was fine for a while. But then within a year or so the popping when ANC was on came back. I was working from home now so I no longer necessarily needed ANC so I just dealt with it. But now any time I turn these on it defaults to full ANC and if I have the headphones on there's yet again an extremely loud feedback/screeching noise but now to make matters even worse the button to cycle through the noise cancellation levels only seems to work sporadically so I can't even quickly get them to a usable state when I want to use them.

After this happening with a prior model, being ghosted by Sony support and having the same issues again two iterations later I don't think I'll be buying any Sony hardware again because I simply don't trust them to deliver a finished, reliable product or offer proper support for their hardware.","March 12, 2022"
Sut,1,"The WH1000XM4 headphones sounded great, then after about 4 months when i turned them on a sound of white noise was in the right ear followed by maximum volume chirping sound so loud I had to get them off of my ear as soon as I could. The chirping went away, then it happened again at around 7 months post purchase, I called Sony and the rep said that since I couldn't reproduce the issue that I should wait until it comes back and that they would document the call. I didn't have any issues again until about 18 months after purchase where the chirping came back and became more frequent, I reached out to Sony and they said that I was out of warranty and there was nothing they could do.

This was the last straw for me, I will be moving forward with only purchasing non-sony ""high end"" products as they don't seem to want to support their own customers.","October 3, 2023"

When the headphones are removed, the sound disappears and will not return, even if the video continues to play, until you disconnect and reconnect them. Although I got them on sale, I find them quite annoying. There are cheaper versions available without these extra features that are more worth their value and are $100 cheaper (also by Sony). These headphones may be suitable only for mobile devices, but if you use them with a laptop, they can be a real nuisance. Unless you find them on sale, there is no reason to purchase them.

update: they are also very hard to Bluetooth connect to other products... so it's getting very annoying to have them despite having good noise canceling","October 15, 2023"
B. Dryal,1,"These headphones are incredibly dangerous. They randomly emit a very loud screeching sound, similar to the feedback a guitar makes when it's too close to an amplifier. The sound is louder than if I had the volume turned completely up, and will absolutely damage the user's hearing. I contacted Sony about this and they told me to contact a third party repair shop to evaluate (and weren't willing to replace my unit). I tried everything from resetting them to updating the firmware, but nothing worked.

Besides that deal breaker, my previous gripe was the horrible pairing notification: every time you turn on the headphones and they pair, this loud voice tells you that you're connected. Unbelievable that you can't turn it off. This alone made me want to ditch these.

Spending almost $400 (at the time) for a paperweight makes me want to avoid all Sony products moving forward, especially those that can cause permanent hearing damage.","October 9, 2023"
WisdomCI,1,"I spent significant amount of time reading reviews upon reviews and was enamored by this latest Sony WH-1000XM4 headphone based on other people's experience. So, I went along and ordered the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphone. Everything I read in the reviews were mostly correct, except that no one reported or caught the fact that the Sony WH-1000XM4 is incompatible with the new Samsung TV operating system, Tizen.

Simply put, the device does not work with new model Samsung TVs built on the Tizen operating system. The audio lags irredeemably with as much as 2-4 seconds (not micro or milliseconds, but full seconds!). In fact the video/picture has moved on many times, while the audio is playing catch up. After a while it also start producing terrible statics and extremely poor sound quality. After an exhaustive google search to see if this was just a problem with my headphone. I discovered a few users with the versions of Samsung TV reported same complaints, but Sony appears not concerned about this complaints because apparently, its only new Samsung TV users that are affected.

The static noises that come on very often can be temporarily corrected switching the DSEE Extreme Auto on and off. But this lasts just a few minutes, before the statics sound quality returns. For a costly/expensive headphone this to me was unacceptable. It has been a few months that Sony has refused to release a firmware to fix this anomaly. I tested my Samsung Tizen TV with cheaper headphones, and there was no audio lag. I therefore had to returned the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphone and settled for the Jabra Elite 85h, which does not have these problems.

The Sony WH-1000XM4 was as described and comes with 'sophisticated' features. All these have no value to me because I bought this headphone to use with my TV especially. I also found that the battery life is perhaps half of what was advertised when ANC is turned on.

I only recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4 only if you never need to use this for Samsung TV with Tizen operating System. The headphone works perfectly with my larger Samsung TV that is Android operating system.

Sony need to fix this terrible bug. I may reconsider if they do, else, its not worth the price with this bug.","March 4, 2021"
Lisa O,1,"I have tried a bunch of noise cancelling headphones in this price range, including Sennheiser, Shure, and Bowers and Wilkins. While these were most comfortable of all of them, they were the worst sounding by far. I cannot understand how these headphones have such a high rating. Maybe they have geat features. I don't know. For me, sound is the most important. Features are nice to have, but sound far outweighs any features. These were not only the worst sounding headphones in this price range,they were some of the worst sounding headphones I have ever heard. There are $50 headphones that sound better than these. I'm really confused as to why these are top rated. I'm a drummer, so clarity and rich bass is super important to me. I use the headphones to play along with. If you want good sounding headphones, look elsewhere.","October 9, 2023"
Thom,1,"Tragically there are very few things I'm an expert in, but sound is one. I listen to 5 hours of music every day on headphones on full volume and I've done that for 25+ years. I've had at least 120 headphones, literally.

After watching countless youtube reviews praising the XM4 as the best NC headphones money could buy today I finally picked one up. I'm now highly suspicious of those reviews. They were likely paid for or perhaps free headphones were given out. The one thing the youtubers know you can't do is listen for yourself. If you actually heard the sound coming out of these headphones it would be instant rejection. The hype is just that. Kudos to Sony's marketing team.

That's not to say this is a bad product. The engineering is top notch. The app is perfect. Hardware is well designed and built to last. Battery seems to never die. Exceptionally light. Stylish. They got everything right except for the sound. (!)

I think these are low quality speakers but they're being manipulated by some very clever software to imitate more expensive hardware. It's cheating and the sound is somehow counterfeit. It works about half the time and the sound quality occasionally gets close to the Bose QC35II. But often these tricks fail and the output is muffled and cringe worthy. It's almost offensive. Repulsive.

This has been marketed to the naive. Judging based on sound these are $40-$80 headphones. The kind of thing you might get given to watch an in flight movie.

Don't buy these headphones. Bose QC35II, or the 700, or if you can take wires Sennheiser 660S. These headphones may be useful for students for listening to lectures. Not for music.

Update: It's been 48 hours and I'm going back to my 2016 QC35II (stuck together with duct tape). These Sony headphones have a perfect design, but the sound is simply awful. It butchers every other song. I can't listen to another minute.","June 15, 2021"
ray,1,"While mowing the law today with my phone in my pocket and locked, the headset would only allow music to play for roughly 30sec at a time, than i had to double tap the right ear to get it to play again. I than took the phone out of my pocket and placed it roughly 10m away, well within the range of the BT of the phone and the headset, ive been as much as 30m away without issue. Still same issue continued.

Sorry but the headset has 1 job, that is to play audio from the connected device. Not to stop the audio every 30sec or so.

This started with the last update to both the app and to the Android OS.

Would not recommend now. Will not consider further Sony devices going forward.

Look great and feel great even after 8+ hours on the phone.

Pro: comfort is far better than expected.
Pro: Sound quality is normally very good. I have had issues sounding like a typical BT device like i was in a tunnel even with my phone in my hand.
Pro: great battery life

Con: Sound quality is normally very good. I have had issues sounding like a typical BT device like i was in a tunnel even with my phone in my hand.
Con: For us older folks the color markings indicating left/right inside the headset are very hard to read. Sony could increase the contrast for those markings.
Con: Seems to drop connection even with phone close by, ie: less than 1m (3ft) away from headset.

Apple app v Android app

The Apple app took pictures of my ears while the Android app did not. Also the Apple app was smoother in the setup than the Android. This is a bit disappointing as my Android is my main phone, the Apple phone is for work only. This does mean while working the headset does perform great. When making personal calls is when I have noticed the sound quality drop off most times.","December 27, 2020"
Keith R. Castelli,1,"Apparently a known thing, google it. Thought I may have just had bad luck, but I'm on my third pair. They just randomly decide to stop charging and you have to find weird workarounds. Some people have had luck holding the power while plugging them in. Or have issues where they only charge if they were powered on when plugged in, or only charge in certain positions, or only charge for a few minutes and have to be re-plugged in. Sony has done nothing to address the issue going from the 3 to the 4 series from what I see online. So would avoid the 5s without doing research as well. I was so concerned it was something with my power that I bought new charging gear and a put a UPS behind them to make sure I was getting clean power. No difference. They just charge when they want to.

It is extremely frustrating to own a premium product that when it's working is great (though the microphone quality is worse than the much older Bose QC2s according to coworkers who use them for ANC in noisy environments).

If it weren't for the fact that half the time I can't use them because I power them on after charging only to hear ""Low Battery"" after a few minutes of use, they'd be a great product. But you don't get three bad units in a row, and if you do, that itself is a problem with their manufacturing.","November 1, 2022"
Escapement Dog,1,"I put the head phones on, start my favorite song, the sound is great and I can't even hear the electric heater that has been running nonstop all winter.

The song gets to the good part and I start to sing ""Bye bye Miss American Pie!"" and then BEEPand the music stops and I can hear the heater all over again. I look at my phone, the music is still going but I can't hear it. I restart the music, nothing. I power cycle the head phones, music starts up again, the heater can't be heard, I start to sing ""Bye Bye"" and then beep, no music.

After some digging I find a setting in the app, an absurd thing called ""Speak to chat"". Who needs to speak to people while their noise canceling headphones are on? Take the phones off you sociopath!

So I turn off the feature and everything is great for a few days until it turns on again. It's like having kids around and having them gank the radio whenever you try to sing. ""Daddy Daddy you sound like a frog!"" it's a cute thing from a kid, unwanted in head phones.

Anyway, this is buggy software. It's not the only bad feature.

Two device support only allows one of the sound sources to work. So what happens when you pair to something like a laptop? Well, everytime the laptop wakes up a little it steals the connection from the phone for 10 seconds. Two device support is useless.

Or what about Zoom? Sometimes the head phones decides that Zoom is a phone call, and then it switches to phone audio, except Zoom doesn't send audio via the phone so now you can't hear anything. So not usable with Zoom.

It seems like sometimes it's better, probably because the app and headphones are auto updating, but as of today it back to flipping speak to talk on and the headphones still are not usable with zoom. It creates a little bit of stress for me everytime I use them.","February 16, 2021"
catamountgapblues,1,"TL;DR: Great headphones....but boy are they fragile.

The XM4s are excellent headphones. Bose only dreams about being able to match the sound quality and noise cancellation on these. They pass the screaming baby on a plane test with flying colors. They're so comfortable you'll forget that you're wearing them. They were the best headphones I ever had...until they broke.

After just over six months of use, I turned the ear cups to lay them flat (something I've done dozens of times), and plastic and metal when flying from pivot point. Flying plastic and metal, not from dropping them or stepping on them, but from folding them as the manufacturer designed to be folded. I found the Customer Service Center to be friendly, but ultimately unhelpful. They referred me to United Radio for repair services, which was quoted as $90 (for shipping and labor), with an additional cost for parts after an assessment. I priced the part I think I'll need through Sony's authorized parts dealer (Encompass) and which runs $120.95, which comes to a grand total of $210.95....when I purchased the headphones for $278.

I've never been so glad that I purchased an external warranty in my life. Here's to hoping Asurion comes through, and if not I guess my next pair of headphones will have to be sub-par Bose.

(Update 11/2021) Thanks to Asurion I was able to (foolishly) get another pair of XM4 with minimal out of pocket cost; however, after being exceptionally paranoid and treating the second pair of headphones with kid gloves, less than four months later I have a pile of plastic and metal, and a dangling ear cup...again. After looking at other reviews this seems to be a more common problem that Sony wants to admit.

The sound quality on these are top-notch, is it really too much to ask for the build quality to match?","July 12, 2021"
Cpustejovsky,1,"After roughly 19 months of use, the noise cancelling on these headphones broke. If Ambient Sound Control is on, a piercing whistling noise emits from the left ear.

If you look up ""WH-1000mx4 whistling noise"", you will see many similar stories. This problem seems to happen after the warranty expires so the buyer is left paying for repairs or replacements

These headphones are not worth the money.","November 23, 2023"
Don't believe in reviews,1,"There are two major flaws. The swivels that connect the earcup housing are extremely weak and WILL break within a year or so. The right side broke in 10 months and the left one broke 2 months after the first damage. The problem will be solved if I can find the swivels only and replace. But in reality, Sony does not make swivels and you would have to buy a whole new earcup housing which is about $150. Obviously, this is not something you'd expect from a decent $350 headphone that is less than a year old and it does not make sense to spend another $150 for cheaply made plastics (that will break again) for $350 headphone.

The second one is the ""skull-penetrating-feedback"" sound on my left earcup (for some people it's the right side) when it is on ""noise-canceling"" mode. In the beginning it started with a minor ""whirring"" sound then slowly progressed to a sharp feedback. To make this horrible sound goes away, I would have to switch to ""ambient"" sound mode. But as a musician, I want to hear my music in a noise canceling environment but I can't do that or I would lose my hearing caused by that feedback.

When you contact customer service, they cannot help despite these two problems are the most common ones. Just go to their official site and check the posted messages. This tells that Sony does aware of these flaws but doesn't care. All in all, this will be my first and last experience with Sony headphone.","September 21, 2022"
Noah Perry,1,"I bought these on Thursday, 10/14 and I was super hyped to use them when they came in today (Friday, 10/15).

I KID YOU NOT. I turned them on and the first thing I noticed was that the right side sounded significantly quieter than the left side did. However, it seemed like maybe this was just some sort of start up issue as shortly after, the left side appeared to normalize and play at the same volume as the right side.

No sooner after this issue seemed to correct itself (these headphones were updated to the newest firmware, I watched it update and install in the Sony Headphones app right in front of me), when suddenly ALL sound immediately STOPS playing on the right side.

Literally, in under an HOUR after opening them, brand new.

I've tried factory resetting them to no avail. Since then the right side blatantly doesn't play at all. I am actually shocked at how comical this is. I read so many great reviews about them and had highly weighed them against Bose alternatives. I go with Sony for the first time ever... and I was played, just like that.

I opened these a little over an hour ago now, and less than 2 hours later I'm writing this review after just having spoke to Amazon Support. Now I have to wait 3-5 business days for my money back. Is this forreal? I'm shocked, let down, and disappointed. Never has any product broken right in front of me in such a short span. They seemed really cool too. I would've even been fine with a new, replacement pair. However, I was told that's not an alternative, so I guess this is the first and ONLY pair of Sony headphones I will own. Wow.","October 15, 2021"
Brittany Love,1,"I was extremely disappointed when I received these headphones. The sound quality isn’t anything special and the bass was so disappointing I couldn’t believe it. I returned them the very next day…. I was really looking forward to enjoying these and even thought about keeping them, but I just couldn’t do it. Every time I went to listen to something, I just got even more frustrated with these…","December 10, 2023"
Motoi Namihira,1,"So as a product, the XM4 are fine. As most other reviews indicate they work pretty good...till they don't. I had this product for a little over a year when I started noticing that the sound cancellation wasn't quite what I expect. Once I started testing, it was clear that the noise cancelation had stopped working. I reached out to Sony support and after an hour or so basically got well your product definitly isn't working but its out of the warranty period so all we can do is suggest you get it fixed. Note, not by them. It wasn't like they said hey send it in, we'll fix it but seeing it's out of warranty we'll have to charge you. They're response was ""yeah you should really find someone who can help you with that"". (ok they did give me a list of ""authorized service partners"", but basically the same thing)

My girlfriend also has the same model. Hers did the same thing. Also after a year. While a sample size of 2 is obviously not reflective of their overall QA, if you're deciding between Sony and Bose, I'd recommend Bose. I have had several Bose products over the years, and none have failed yet. One I've had for 7 years now and while the battery life is reduce, otherwise still works like the day I bought it.","January 27, 2023"
Dingo,1,"In early June I purchased one of the SoundCore noise canceling headsets. The set performed flawlessly for about a month.

I operate a lot of noisy equipment and over the past five years I have owned Bose, Sony, Samsung (purchased through Amazon) and Raycon (in ear, purchased directly from Raycon) active noise hearing protection. They all have become useable due to battery failure, me breaking them one way or another.

Back to SoundCore I was impressed with the noise canceling of the SoundCore and they compared well alongside my other headsets, and the price was 1/4 of the others named. The mic/Bluetooth function was nowhere close to any of the above headsets and I always had to shut down my equipment if I needed to communicate with anyone the phone. But there is that price thing again, and the need for noise canceling far outweighed my need to talk on my phone.

My problem arose in about a month when the left side started to pulse and really hurt my ear. I contacted SoundCore as directed by Amazon and they responded immediately (a big plus). They asked for the S/N and proof of purchase. Both were supplied. Now its December and I have heard nothing from SounCore even though I have sent a half dozen emails to their support group. Nothing.... So it is hit or miss.

Having said, that I just purchased 3 more SoundCore headsets and will give them as Christmas gifts. I hope they last longer than my original.

Bottom line.... these are exceptional hearing protection headsets, if they last they are well worth the money, if not, don't expect SoudCore to live up the their advertised 18 warranty.","December 9, 2021"
Unreal Name,1,"Let's start with the good. The noise cancellation is incredible. The sound quality is also quite good, when it works. That's the rub.

Cons:
Connectivity
Connection is fiddly on a good day and mostly just doesn't work well. The internal bluetooth antenna is terrible compared to other headphones I have used. The headphones constantly connect and disconnect.

Bluetooth features
no aptx low latency, so useless for video and games

Fit
These say they are over the ear but are smaller than any over the ear cans I've owned. They rest on my ears and thus hurt after a few hours :(

Built in Alexa
The technical term for this is a lie. There is NO BUILTIN ALEXA. What they mean by, ""built in alexa"", is that you can assign one of the two hardware buttons on the headphones to alexa. When you press this, if you are connected to your phone and if the software works, then it will run alexa on your phone. In practice I never got this to work on my android phone.

Connecting to multiple devices
Not what it sounds like. This is actually the same, ""feature"", that most headphones implement, only MUCH worse. ie you can pair them to a bunch of devices and then easily switch the connection over.
Only through the app, only to 2 discrete devices and the connection is noisy and twitchy and continuously shifts back and forth

Basically none of the features really works. The adaptive environment feature cuts in and out. The touch controls half work and seem to randomly misinterpret gestures etc etc

While stereo music sounds great, the hands free mode has VERY bad quality. You can not use the quality stereo mode if you use the mic, so games, zoom meetings etc sound like a tin can.

Oh and doing anything requires the app.","October 19, 2020"
Justin J. Norman,1,"I spent both a live chat session and SIX phone calls with Sony customer support trying to get these to work properly, to no avail. This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've made recently. Arguably the biggest selling point of the XM4 over the XM3 headphones is the multi-device connection feature, which supposedly lets you switch automatically between two devices. Without this feature, you may as well buy the XM3 headphones for $100-$150 less. It doesn't work when paired with MacBook Pro and iPhone. I've tried everything — restoring the headphones to default settings, deleting and reinstalling the app, deregistering and re-registering the headphones from both devices — nothing works. Search the Sony subreddit and you'll find a bunch of posts with the exact same problem when using a Mac and iPhone with this feature. The headphones will not switch connection to the second device. Both my MacBook and iPhone are running the latest versions of their respective OS. The MacBook is a 16"" model from 2016 and the iPhone is an XS.

It seems completely nuts to me that Sony didn't detect this issue before putting these on the market. After six support phone calls and a live chat session, Sony did not offer to replace my unit. They told me the problem was with my computer and if I would like to return the headphones, I could. It would be one thing if the headphones had a compatibility warning that says ""Does not work with MacBook Pros"" or something, but there is no such warning. So if you use a Mac and an iPhone and you're thinking about getting these, please realize you may find yourself spending many futile hours trying to get this feature to work. If you don't care about that feature, I'm sure they're a great buy. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is excellent. Just pick up a pair of XM3 headphones instead and save yourself a chunk of cash.","August 27, 2020"
Corbin Shouse,1,"This is my second pair of the WH-1000 series since the original XM3 broke after about 15 months. I decided to try again because otherwise the headphone were working well so I purchased the XM4s in July of 2022. I take great care of these headphones and they live either in the case or on my ears when they're not charging. They were great until a few days ago when I was wearing them and took them off and the hinge snapped. Now one of the earphones dangles and they are unwearable. They are supposed to be covered under the 1-year warranty, but I've spoken to two different Sony representatives and they both say this type of damage is not covered under warranty since the company considers it 'accidental'. I tried to explain that this occurred with normal, expected customer use and therefore shouldn't be considered 'accidental'. I've escalated the concern but so far haven't heard back from their customer service department. I am very disappointed for the $348 I spent on these. You would expect them to last a lot longer for that much money. I suggest buying a different set of headphone due to very poor durability/build quality.","April 9, 2023"
Janna,1,"I ordered this product because I appreciate the noise-cancelling feature for work and travel. Unfortunately, the headphones did not function. I called Sony to troubleshoot. We were not able to resolve the issue, so I Fedexed the product to Sony for a replacement on June 8th. It is June 27th, and Sony still has not sent the headphones. (I received notice that the headphones were received on June 24th.) I travel internationally for work and won't be back in the US for some time. Sony would not expedite the process of sending another headset, and will not ship to my new location. So I am out over $300 and have no headphones. I have never left a one-star review in my life, but I am so disappointed with the lack of customer service and slowness in response. I wish I had sent the headphones back to Amazon instead of Sony. If you buy from Amazon and have a problem with your device, don't make the same mistake I did. Send it back to Amazon. Their customer service is rapid.

Update: Two weeks after receiving the defective headphones, Sony finally sent a replacement. Unfortunately, they sent the earbuds instead of the headphones. Before Sony would act, I had to prove that I'd purchased the headphones by uploading my receipt, then I had to FedEx the earbuds back. I waited another two weeks to hear from them. In the meantime, I bought a pair of Bose QuietComfort headphones. They work perfectly. I still haven't received the Sony headphones....","June 27, 2022"
Brandon,1,"I'm just past the 2 year warranty and the Active Noise Canceling (ANC) creates a feedback loop in the cups. Very loud monotone that will destroy your hearing.
You can stop this by switching to Ambient Sound or another mode, but the device always powers on in ANC mode, so be careful. So far there is no sure way of fixing it.
Got these for $400 when there were no MX5's on the market yet. $400 for only 2 years? Nah. I'd give these a 5 star review if not for this BLAIRING issue. Again, started happening just outside of the warranty.
I can't recommend these to anyone.","October 1, 2023"
jimrandomh,1,"UPDATE: After three months of use, I'm editing my review to one star and buying a pair of something else. In addition to the issues below, several times it's unexpectedly muted itself during a call, while remaining connected by Bluetooth, and not I haven't been able to get sound back except by power cycling it. Each time this happened, I missed almost a full minute of a business meeting, and that's really not acceptable.

Previous review (was 3 star) below:
The sound quality and noise cancellation are pretty good. But unfortunately, the battery is often dead when I need it. Not because the battery life is particularly short, but because a combination of individually-small problems add up to one major problem.

Problem one: The sensor that detects whether it's on your head or not is unreliable, so it will sometimes drain its battery to zero while sitting on a desk.
Problem two: It can be used with a dead battery (as wired audio only, no mic or noise cancelling), but if you try to charge it while using it in this mode, it makes a very painful high-pitched noise.
Problem three: It can't be used in powered mode and charged at the same time; plugging in a charger shuts it off, regardless of the battery level.
Problem four: The low-battery notification is very long and it silences the regular audio, so if it happens during a call, you'll have to ask for something to be repeated

Put these all together, and the practical upshot is that I can't rely on these headphones, I have to keep a backup pair of some other brand on my desk.","December 26, 2021"
James,1,"I'm used to wearing my Bose QC35II headphones for no joke 18 hours a day sometimes. There have been many times where I take them fully charges, put them on, and don't take them off until the battery dies(they're older so I don't get a full 24 hours from them anymore). Anyway the point I'm making is I'm used to wearing headphone, and I'm used to ANC.

But these Sony headphones have a very shallow earcup, so the cheap foam stuff on the inside will press against your ears making them unbearably itchy. I would have to take them off to scratch my ears every 10 minutes, and after 30 minutes i'd have to take them off completely. They also feel substantially lower build quality then the Bose. The ANC is better on the Sony, and the audio quality is probably a touch better too, but for me I want something I can wear for more than a few songs, so I had to return these. I have NO idea how these made it out of product testing and 4 generations later they're still so uncomfortable. This seems to be a fairly common complaint so be warned.

The Bose headphones are 1000000x more comfortable, and 95% as good at sound quality/ANC. I've traveled around the world with them for years and they're still kicking just fine, I only ordered these because my company was paying for an office supply upgrade. I think I'll try the Bose QC45s.","June 30, 2022"
Tony M.,1,"I received my first pair of these headphones last November. I'd never spent this kind of money on myself for such a luxury item. When they arrived I was over the moon because the sound quality was amazing. About six weeks later, I took them off my head and place them on a side table. And I am very careful with the things I own. I never had much money growing up, so you learn to take care of your possessions. Anyways when I went to use them again, the left ear had broken off of the head band and was hanging from the wires. I contacted Sony who's response was, we don't cover damage. WHAT? I argued with them for quite a while and a few days later they agreed to replace them.

Fast forward a few months later. Now I am EXTRA carful with my second pair because of the problems with the first pair. I am literally removing the headphones from my ears when the same exact thing happens again. There was NO WAY that I broke them. I have all the parts (see image) and the plastic is so thin that it just can't handle the weight of the ear pad.

I called Sony again and they flat out refused to help me. They told me they don't cover damage and that the best they would do would be to give me a 10% coupon for another pair. What a joke!

RDA,1,"Do not buy Sony Headphones if you value you ears. They nearly deafened me. 130 decibels straight to the right ear and I am 2 hours after the blast and my ear still feels weird. The sound was what happens you give to much power to a speaker and blow it. I popped out my earcups and did not see the wax build up on the white cylinder that was a know issue.

I also called Sony because I have recommended these headphones to others but after they nearly blow my eardrum out I will have to tell that these headphones are dangerous and Sony doesnt have a fix or desire to fix the headphones or the prcoess to make them. I got hung up on and then run around by another customer support person and the person above him. I think Mary was the upper level person.

I am legitimately disgusted that a company would not have the faith in their product to try to fix the issue or help out someone that they could have caused a really bad injury if they were using their headphones to exercise or cook which I do. 6 months out of warranty on a $350 product and they were worse than Best Buy, HyperX, Newegg, and even Walmart.

Yes I am angry because when I make product and it hurts someone badly I accept their product and at least try to figure out the issue.","June 27, 2022"
Stephania Timmons,1,"I just have to say for the money spent on these I need an application that isn't restricted to just phones. The connect app is always glitching, and more issues come up with these headphones every day. I wish I had just got the Boise headphones and saved myself the money.

The audio is good, and sound cancelling is good, but the headphones become useless if the app doesn't work properly. You can connect two devices which is the only real way to pair to a pc, use the app to pair to your phone and then 2nd device as pc. So anytime I'm watching something and need to work on my phone I lose pc audio.

If you try and use these for work, i.e. connecting to PC and calling others through skype or zoom, you always sounds like you are ""in a tunnel"" to the person on the other end of the line. Ideally I'm making anywhere from 70 -100 calls a day and these will not serve that purpose. Unless you don't want people to be able to hear you.

I now have a very expensive pair of headphones that really only serve the purpose of listening to videos on my pc, until the app messes up and tries to connect to my phone. Well maybe turn your bluetooth off on the phone, then you get random beeps while the headphones try to connect to the phone.

Please don't waste your money, I've had these headphones since December and they are only getting worse. I should have bought Boise, which my friend has and uses for work, with no issues.

Placeholder,1,"I bought 2 of these headphones, expensive! Neither pair will stay connected to my iPhone while I’m listening to music. They disconnect every few seconds. Before buying, I was told they would connect with android or Apple devices. Just not true. I have looked at the newer Sony headphones that came out a short while ago and the reviews for those say the same thing. Believe them. I have purchased mostly Sony electronics my entire life. I particularly like the added bass sound they play out.
Disappointed! My opinion is, for Apple people these are not a choice. Save yourself the trouble of returning them or worse being stuck with them after paying the high dollar price.","September 6, 2023"
E.Bryson,1,"After using the headphones for a couple hours daily, the right ear appears have had an issue with the active noise cancelling that causes a very loud high pitched squeak in the right ear. Without this issues I would have given these 5 stars as they were great before that. Contacting Sony led to them running me about and saying the device was out of warranty and I could contact an external repair company if I wanted to fix them. This has been a very disappointing experience for me as I loved these headphones before they broke and just wanted to keep using them. I recommend looking into this issue before you buy as I am far from the only one with this experience.","August 20, 2023"
Matthew,1,"I got these as a Christmas gift in 2021, and now in December 2022 I’m regretting it. Now, after about 30 minutes of use, an annoying static sound starts to come out of the left year. It doesn’t matter if I’m listening to music, watching a video, or making a phone call. I’ve tried resetting them, rebooting them, turning the noise cancellation off, turning off ANC, none of it helped. I looked up the problem online and it seems like a lot of users are having this problem a year out from their original purchase date. Some have even had this issue since the first day that they bought them. I’ve reached out to Sony, and they were less than helpful in helping me get them fixed. The problem, according to those on the internet, is moisture building up on the screwheads in the cup of the headphone. Sony hasn’t seemed to be helping anyone with this issue, as there is no solution on their product blog either. I tried to use the warranty to have Sony repair them, and they refused my warranty request because it was December 2nd, 2022 and the headphones were purchased November 30th, 2021, so they were technically not in warranty anymore. I do not recommend these expensive headphones if you want to use them for more than a year.","December 7, 2022"
D. Whitworth,1,"I bought these headphones 2 months ago and have been using them 30-45 minutes a day while I am on my exercise bike.

Update Oct 20, 2022. After spending 30 minutes to an hour with Sony support recently and going through their troubleshooting steps they determined I was eligible for a replacement pair of headphones. They emailed a shipping label to me and I had to go and buy a box to ship them back. About 2 weeks later I got a new pair of headphones that was sealed in a box. These are charging so far but I am afraid to use them daily like I was using them before. I haven't charged them since the first time and I don't know how long these will last. They really feel premium and they come in a nice case. I just don't know how long they will last if you use them daily. I searched online and many others have had the same charging issue. The sound quality is fine. I just expected the original set to last longer than 2 months and maybe 3 or 4 charging cycles.","August 23, 2022"
Shadow133,1,"The Sony headset boasts excellent sound quality, effective noise isolation, and comfort. Its aesthetic appeal is noteworthy. However, usability is hindered by small, hard-to-reach buttons and an overly sensitive touch feature.

It's a shame such an expensive product provides only one year of warranty support, and it's a shame they are so unreliable. I looked online, and it seems this is a common problem with these headphones.

Rubén,1,I bought these because people told me they had really good sound and bass. When I bought them i did notice they were pretty good headphones and I loved them for the first few weeks but after a while they started acting weird. At times while I was listening music the speak to chat would turn on without me activating it and there were times where they would turn off while they had battery. When I tried to turn them back on they did but then turn off again. Right now I've charged them and everything but they won't turn on,"August 25, 2023"
Carter,1,"I was incredibly disappointed with these headphones. The noise canceling is ok not great, nothing like the reviews lead me to believe. By far the most frustrating thing is that the sensor that is supposed to auto detect and pause the music when you remove the headphones does not work at all. It is for sure enabled in the app. I will take these off and set them down on a table with the sensor pointing straight up and it never stops.

I had two pairs of Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 headphones over 5 years. They are a third of the price of these sony's and they worked 100x better than these. The auto pause worked perfectly, and if I removed them they would turn themselves off after a matter of time. I would have to charge them like once a month.

I expected these sony headphones to do the same, but they never auto turn off. Every single time I pick them up the battery is dead. I know I could be responsible and turn them off when I'm done, but sometimes I just set them down without thinking.

I would happily go back to the headphones I had before. They may not have sounded as good but they were much more enjoyable to own.","September 15, 2022"
Amazon Customer,1,"I've had these headphones for 14 months when the noise cancelling in the left ear suddenly started to sound like a seashell does when you press it to your ear. Constantly. It also randomly emits a brain piercing feedback squeal. I haven't been able to narrow down any triggers for it. I work from home with children, so noise cancelling is necessary -- this product defect makes them unusable.

Upon contacting Sony support, the wonderful person assisting me (no sarcasm, they were great and I refuse to hold them responsible for Sony's poor policy) informed me that since I was outside of the one year warranty that I would have to pay to have them fixed. I refused on principle.

If you're reading this, do me a favor and search 'WH-1000mx4 squealing noise' and 'WH-1000mx3' squealing noise (the previous model)-- don't believe what I've written here, believe what your eyes will tell you.

This manufacturing or design defect has made them unusable. I've never had a ""premium"" product fail so quickly and certainly never had a ""premium"" manufacturer fail to do the right thing and rectify their mistake. I hope that this review saves you my irritation and costs them much more than it would have cost to repair the headphones.","July 28, 2022"
DB,1,"After doing a bit of research and reading the reviews I decided to purchase these.

It is a great product outside the fact that it broke in four months. I used these as you would any normal headphones. I never took them out of the house, they were never dropped, and nothing has been done to these headphones to cause the issue that I am having. As I am watching TV from my bed, the missing piece (see image) pops out and now the right speaker just dangles and spins.

I contacted Amazon customer service but their return policy is 30 days. They also instruct me to contact Sony for warranty.

I contact Sony and speak to international customer service. I explain the issue to the first individual and because, ""We have no record of that happening to anyone else so it isn't covered under warranty"", but if it hasn't happened to anyone else, why has it happened to me?! I called back to speak with another individual only to have him echo the same thing the first person stated. Then when I asked him what's covered under the warranty all he told me is that he would email me a copy of the warranty and then disconnected the call instead of explaining the warranty information that I requested. Their own workers don't know what's covered. I might not ever purchase a Sony product ever again. These headphones are far too expensive to have to deal with this.","September 17, 2021"

UV,1,"**UPDATED REVIEW**- I want to provide an update after I had to replace my headphones. Apparently less than a year in the headphones stopped charging. I tried troubleshooting with customer service but eventually they had to send me a new headphone. Little that I knew when you do that you only get 3m warranty extension not a full new year so AGAIN after 8m or so my headphones stopped charging. After multiple calls to customer service I had no choice but to take the hit. I installed a new battery but it didnt work and Sony said sorry not sorry! Can't help but feel disappointed. Overall these are quality and expensive headphones but I didn't expect them to fail twice in a span of 1y each. Won't buy it again.

Old review:
Bought these about a year ago. Great sound and noise cancellation capabilities. The battery also last for a long time. Headphones are really comfortable but often time I felt that my ears get hot and sweaty so these are definitely not meant for sport/exercise. Unfortunately, after a year of use my headphone didn’t charge so under the warranty Sony replaced it at no cost. I must say that customer service was excellent and the replacement process was easy and smooth.","September 27, 2022"
LarryD,1,"These worked fairly well at 1st but for some reason when I 1st turn them on they will squeal in your ear to the point of being painful. I searched the net and about the only suggestion I found was to move all other transmitting devices away from the head phones.
For the money this should ever have been an issue. I can only use them now when the noise canceling settings are turned off. I could never recommend someone purchasing these. They are way too expensive for the performance.","September 1, 2023"
Jonny Diligent,1,I finally convinced myself to purchase some high end headphones. What a huge mistake. First they never speed charged at all. Such a dissaointment day one first time battery was low i did the 15min charge an nothing if i don’t charge a min 1-2hrs it wont play 10 min. I thought i was doing something wrong than about 2 months of use they started to charge randomly meaning i could charge them 3 hrs pick them up an hear battery low please charge than cut off. Some days it worked same port same charge cable.i started smelling electric burn in my office or so i thuaght untill i noticed the plastic around the headphone charge port was melted. Turns out it was the headphones. Other issues i could answer a call or atleast connect but if i wanted to actually speak to the caller i would have to scramble for my phone to switc call to headphone an atleast 50° of calls would hang up before i got there. So everycall was a phone scramble nightmare. Such a dissapointment. Im waiting to hear from sony support ive sent 3 messeges now. They had called me once but the headphones where on an the call dropped before i could switch over. Total dissapointment,"November 17, 2022"
natalie,1,"I was super excited to receive this pair of noise cancelling headphones because I had heard great things and was in the market for a new pair. I received them four days ago without issue. Opened the box, followed the instructions, charged them up, and I was good to go. Today the headphones kindly made me aware that the battery was low and they needed to be charged. So, using the same method as instructed in the manual, I plugged them in. No indicator light turned on. So I tried various different usb adapters with the cord provided in the box and still nothing. I tried other usb-c cords that should have, in theory, worked just as well, and nothing again. I have gone through every single troubleshooting method and advice I could find and they will not charge.
I am disappointed. Using the headphones consistently for the past few days was a good experience, much better than other noise cancelling headphones I have tried in the past. I really enjoyed the ambient sound features, the sound quality, the comfortable fit, and the effectiveness of the noise-cancelling aspect. Bummer that it only lasted 4 days.","November 3, 2022"
Matt Johnson,1,"I purchased these headphones in June of 2021. After having them for a few months I noticed a decline in efficiency of the noise cancellation (ANC). After some Googling, it appears this may have been caused by running the ANC Optimizer in the mobile app. Many have reported this issue and factory resetting does not solve it. Today, just under two years of ownership, the noise cancellation causes a windy, echo-y, tinny sound quality in the right ear. Not only that, it sometimes has an extremely loud feedback noise in that ear. I contacted Sony support, but because the headphones only have a 1-year warranty, there is nothing they can do but give me the phone number of a repair center where I would have to pay out-of-pocket. These were great when I first got them, but I just can't recommend them after this experience. A pair of headphones this expensive should last much longer than a couple years without an issue.","May 2, 2023"
David Raymond Sladky,1,"So I purchased these because they where supposed to be the best, right up there with Bose.
Well, at first I would agree, noise cancellation was awesome, connection was easy, sound was awesome.
Then after a few weeks they got the dreaded static everyone talks about. I did a few things suggested on the internet to fix the concern to no avail.
I reached out to amazon for an exchange, they where happy to help and sent a new set out right away.
This set worked great also, for 1 week only, then static.

Amazon was honestly great again, agreeing to send me another set.

So far this set is working great, no static after weeks of use.

So while I love these, it is apparently a crap shoot as to you getting a good quality set.

Would I purchase them again, yes I think I would, only because Amazon made the exchange process so easy. No I do not work for Amazon, they just really surprised me with the great service. They even sent each new set out fast shipping before I sent the old pair in.

So good luck on getting a good set, if you do you will love them. I would suggest getting them through Amazon fulfillment since they are probably going to fail at least once.","March 28, 2022"

David Naumann,1,"For expensive headphones there is no excuse for the pains it takes to use this in many common use cases. Whether it be as a pair of headphones for your laptop at work where you occasionally have to use it for both music and calls. Whether it be as a standalone solution to listen to music off your phone as you are moving around. In these scenarios these headphones just miss the mark for the price point. As I ran into headache inducing stutters which had to be fixed on a device level basis (both a windows laptop and android phone, possibly Apple products may be better) in regards to Bluetooth connectivity. Even in LDAC mode, a Bluetooth mode pioneered by Sony for audiophiles, I still ran into many cases of stutters and unreliable connections to modern hardware. Then came in the spotty noise cancelling software. If you want to both noise cancel and move around at the same time then these will not be the headphones for you. You'll either have to spend a good bit of times in the menus setting up the perfect working condition for these headphones or grit your teeth as it swaps between modes. These headphones are just not up to spec of what they should be at the current price point.

TL;DR: Spotty bluetooth connectivity, poor handling of noise cancelling software and just a bad experience. Would not recommend.","December 27, 2021"
Matt T.,1,"Don’t buy these headphones without purchasing the extra warranty. I purchased these headphone 12/05/2021 for over $250 They were very highly rated. Loved the sound. Kept them in their nice case. They all of a sudden stopped working after a year and a half, (outside of Sonys one year warranty by 6 months). Sony does not stand behind their headphone. My opinion is they are designed to fail after a year. I was told the headphones would have to be sent in to be maintenances, at about the cost of new ones. These headphones are not water resistant in the slightest, not even a light perspiration.","July 11, 2023"
Baldev Dhaliwal,1,"comfortable, good battery life, quick charging. much of the headphones functionality are relegated to a touch sensitive pad on the right ear cup. said touch controls are wildly inconsistent. quality of life features like speak-to-chat are intrusive and counterintuitive. does not play with windows 11 well either and constantly drops itself into a lower-bandwidth mode despite the integrated mic being completely disabled in windows settings. noise cancellation is very good however the audio passthrough branded Ambient Noise Control is far behind what apple's airpod pro series is capable of. significantly worse experience than continuing to use the semi-broken quietcomfort 35 headphones i've had up until replacing them with these. i would get a refund at this point if i could.","July 4, 2023"
Murray Friedberg,1,"I was exceptionally impressed with these headphones. The battery life and sound quality was phenomenal... but it only charged once before breaking. The second time I plugged it in to charge, it would not charge at all. I went through all of the troubleshooting steps unsuccessfully, and trying to contact the Sony customer support services made open heart surgery look simple. I am very unhappy with the fragility of this product given that extreme abuse that my old Bose headphones have survived.","September 22, 2023"
Jess,1," First 1.5 years of owning these headphones were amazing! Super comfortable (they're wearable for 8+ hours at a time!), excellent noise canceling even if you're not listening to anything and just want some quiet, great battery life, lightning fast charging, intuitive controls, and real sleek looking. I was in love with these headphones.

But after the 1.5~1.75 year mark, they started with an eardrum-piercing noise, suddenly. It sounds like mic feedback, very high-pitched, very loud! I looked online and apparently this is a common issue with these headphones (and possibly other Sony ANC headphones, but I didn't look too much into that). There's also some clicking that happens now, which sometimes preceeds the feedback-sounding noise. I tried every 'fix' out there, but nothing has worked. The noise used to come up when I first connected and sometimes after using them a long while, but now I can't get it to stop.

These things were over $300! At that price point, this product should have lasted several years without major issues like this one that render it useless.

Very disappointed in these headphones, given the price and how great they performed at the start.","April 15, 2023"
Daniel R. Hall,1,"Edit. 12/9/20
Decided to give this another chance. This time I bought one renewed. Upon receipt I noticed there was a carrying bag in the package (these headphones should not come in a bag). After pulling out the headphones, they were not Sony WH-1000XM4, but some Samsungs. Obviously, nobody checked before shipping or replaced them during shipping. The tape on the box, that thanks me for giving the item a second life, was pull off. It looked to be tampered with. I guess I won't be giving these another chance and I'm not sure if I'll ever give 'renewed' another chance either.

Original review:
ANC is great, but situational. Please understand that ANC does not make music sound better. It blocks out ambient sounds, noise and voices. It won't cancel out direct wind nor your chewing. While the sound is very good, I'm sticking with my Sennheiser Momentum TW's, which in my opinion sound better. Mid's to me sound a bit muted, otherwise the highs and lows are pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of over the head cans either, but I was willing to give these a shot. Being able to pair these and have them connected to multiple devices is a big plus, but as always trying to use these (BT) as a computer mic/headset is a very poor experience, especially with Discord (I really wish companies could figure this out). Great battery life and these can be updated with firmware for future proofing. The white is not really white, it's more gray and contrary to some belief, they do not look more premium, but they don't look cheap either. It's personal preference really.","August 31, 2020"
Lesia Brightful,1,"I bought these for my daughter as a special gift. These things are EXPENSIVE! In fact, the most expensive headphones I've ever purchased. She started complaining that they didn't work. I thought she was doing something wrong. But, I tested them and she was right. They simply stop playing music randomly. Every 2-3 minutes, they just stop playing music / sound. It's beyond annoying, and now the warranty is out. If Sony is listening to this, please replace these. Otherwise, I will never buy another Sony product ever. For now, I must recommend avoiding this product","July 15, 2023"
Amazon Customer,1,"I ordered these thinking I was getting a new pair of headphones. They showed up and looked fine but the app notes that they were previously paired to a device and they were not packaged correctly for a new pair. I've watched enough unboxing videos on these headphones to know how they are supposed to look out of the box. If I wanted a used pair of headphones, I would've paid less for a used pair. Unacceptable.","September 24, 2023"
Adam V.A.,1,"These headphones sound A LOT better than my old Bose QuietComform 35s. They are also VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Comfort will vary person-to-person. I can wear the Bose headphones all day. I don't have a giant melon or huge ears. I couldn't stand the MX4s on my head for more than 10 minutes. Too much inward pressure collapses the foam on the earcups making the speaker mechanism press on my ears.

The controls on the MX4 are surprisingly bad. The touch/swipe controls don't work well. They are imprecise and flakey. The automated controls related to noise cancelling modes have to be turned off. When left on, they will switch in/out of noise cancelling modes frequently when the headphones think background noise is YOU trying to have a conversation. ...This is super annoying.

The bluetooth behavior is ridiculous and unacceptable. It was difficult to pair the headphones with a new Galaxy Note - failed ~20 times before finally connecting. After battling through pairing my personal and work phones, the MX4s switched between them without warning and for no obvious reason. When I paired a 3rd device to the headphones, they continuously connected/dropped two of the devices over and over. ...Manually disconnecting one of the devices didn't help. The headphones would re-connect automatically and drop one of the other devices. The only solution was to ""forget"" the third device. My old Bose headphones handled this same setup with no issues.

Given these issues, I can't believe these headphones get so many positive reviews on Youtube. The sound quality does not overcome the usability problems.","October 20, 2020"
Neil Kolar,1,"I was really, really looking forward to these headphones. When they were on Amazon's Black Friday deal, I decided to pull the trigger. The box arrived undamaged and everything was perfect. I unboxed them, downloaded the app on my phone and proceeded to do the setup. During the setup, I was blown away!!! I had never heard such spatial audio from any headphone before! Keep in mind I have Sennheiser, Beats, JBL and Bose to compare them to and Sony's sound was outstanding! I got everything setup, updated the firmware (which did take a while) and was incredibly excited to listen to music. I fired up Spotify and was amazed.....for 5 seconds. Then the audio cut out. Then it eventually came back. Then a few seconds later, it cut out again. This kept going on and on. I tried turning off every setting in the app, made sure my phone has no other bluetooth devices connected to it yet the problem persisted. I then tried placing a phone call with the same results. I then pulled up a basic game on the phone with the same results. I went back through the Sony configuration app and everything was perfect.....through their app. As soon as I tried something else, the problem persisted. After 3 hours of trying everything I could think of, I gave up. Every other headphone I have used has worked flawlessly after 10-15 minutes of configuration. Spending 3 hours on something that I was excited about and wanted to work yet wouldn't was disheartening.","December 5, 2020"
Sayed Nasser,1,"While this headphone works, it’s amazing although it has a huge manufacturing issue with the noise, canceling microphones, after exactly a year of purchasing the headphones, it started producing high-pitched noise, which is fairly common with other consumers, and it has been reported to Sony. If you are purchasing this headphone, keep in mind that it will last for approximately one year, and after that, the noise canceling feature will start falling apart..","September 25, 2023"
Nicholas Spencer,1,"I have to say straight away that I had to return these headphones because of a static/crackling sound in the right earcup that would happen when noise canceling was on. I did some research and saw others were having a similar issue. It's caused by moisture getting inside the headphones and shorting out the noise cancelling chip. I'd babied these headphones but just two weeks later this happened.
Other than that though, the noise cancelling and sound quality were excellent when they worked. The media controls are easy to get used too.
There are only two physical buttons, one for power and a programmable one for either your assistant or cycling through the noise cancelling settings. I wish there were 3 so you don't have to worry about using one or the other. The build quality was ok, but for a $350 pair of headphones, I was expecting a little more, especially when you can get all the same features on some of Sony's own budget options.
Another issue was the side adjustment for your head. The slides were really stiff when I first received the headphones. But within a day, they became extremely loose and would move even when I took my headphones off of my stand.
Overall, they're not really worth the price in my opinion, especially when you can get the Bose 700 for an extra $30, and they broke due to a lack of water or dust resistance. And I'm not asking for them to put a full IP7X rating on them. But right now in Washington's Rainy season when it's humid indoors, it's bs that they couldn't survive it.","November 17, 2020"
Jacob,1,"UPDATE: About two months after I got them they started powering off randomly, and if I try to connect to bluetooth they connect, stutter the music for about 2 seconds, then power off. That's if I'm lucky enough to get them to connect at all. Even after an overnight charge they won't connect to my phone or my computer without this issue. That's if I'm lucky enough to get them to connect to bluetooth at all: most of the time they just power off 3-5 seconds after I turn them on.

Original review:

Touch controls suck: they activate when you're not trying to (e.g. stretching), and they don't activate when you actually do try to use them (the sensitive area is very small and awkwardly positioned). Cannot use the headphones at all while charging, as they seem to turn off completely and will not turn back on. Charge lasts only about one workday, so if you forget to plug them in when you're done, you're SOL next time you want to use them, since they can't be used while charging. Noise canceling is audible. Unusable if you try to connect to 2 devices at once. Mobile app sucks too.

They're lightweight though, I'll give them that, and slightly more comfortable for long wear sessions than the phones I had before.","January 2, 2022"
Gabriela Islava,1,"How are you, I bought the headphones and they don't work, there was no warranty in the box, how can I get it?","December 1, 2023"
Joseph Lescoulie,1,"Microphone does not work anymore, failed after 6 months, warranty replaced. Microphone failed again after 7 months, Sony refused repair citing warranty status only applies to first device. Would not buy again.","November 16, 2023"
Pen Name,1,"After 1 month of using, the headphones don't charge. the red light next to the charge port is on for 5 seconds then turns off.

Really disappointed with this product. Now I am not sure what to do with it. For such expensive headphones, it should just work","October 18, 2023"
T2,1,"Less than a year after purchase, one of the hinges spontaneously snapped rendering the headphone unusable. This is a common issue and they do not honor it in their warranty and refer you to a third party repair service instead.

After repairing that, shortly after I developed an issue in the side that didn't break where in noise cancelling it starts getting feedback and emitting a deafening, highly painful, ear-piercing shriek, making this headset hazardous to use and requiring disabling noise cancelling to avoid. If I could give the noise cancelling less than 1 star for this issue alone I would.

This item will not last long when purchased, and lasted less long than the XM3 I replaced when they similarly encountered the ear screeching issue after about a year of use.

Unless you are ready to spend upwards of $300 per headset multiple times a year I cannot at all recommend these and will not purchase more of their headsets hereafter. That they do not honor their warranty for a product this prone to early failure is too far.","September 14, 2022"
Margot,1,It’s possible I just got a dud but the Bluetooth on this sucks. It’s gotten harder to connect. The transition between devices is not reliably smooth at all. I like the look of it and the ears are very comfy. Sound cancellation doesn’t seem to be better than my boyfriends AirPod pros. If you’re not an audiophile idk if it’s gonna be worth it for you like I don’t think the sound quality is tremendously better than any other headphones I’ve owned. Definitely have some regrets.,"August 23, 2023"
Amazon Customer,1,"At first it worked perfectly. I really enjoyed it for a month or so. I use it constantly during work to make calls and listen to music while I do my reports/write code etc. However, this headphone developed issues that made it usable.

1) When I'm speaking using the headphones there is a crackling sound in response to my voice.

I thought I could ignore this and I could, I guess. But talking to people on my headphones became annoying. The second issue it developed is unbearable.

2) A sort of fan blowing in your ear sound. It only happens when noise cancelling is on. This happens on and off and idk what causes it. A lot of people online talk about this issue.
I cannot bear this noise in my ear and I am sad. I may not be able to return it due to living outside the USA.

People speculate that the moisture in your ear when you sweat caused these issues. There are very hot days where I an from (Trinidad and Tobago) and the humidity is high. This scenario begs the question.

Should these headphone die due to normal humidity in hot countries?
I swear I haven't even removed these from my work desk more than a handful of times.

I am very disappointed in these headphones. There were a gift from my girlfriend and now she is very sad. I don't even want to tell her the extent of the problems :'( so I try to use the headphones on calls with her.","December 12, 2020"
